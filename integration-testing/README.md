### Integration tests

Integration tests required extra credentials, such as for aws and azure,
in order to execute the complete terraform cycle (init, apply, destroy)

For all the testing it needs the common environment variables 
```
    MONGODB_ATLAS_PROJECT_ID
    MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY
    MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY
```

For specific aws related interactions 
```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_REGION

    AWS_CUSTOMER_MASTER_KEY_ID (only required for encryption at rest with customer managed key)

```
