# Old Module Example: Org Invitation (Legacy)

This example demonstrates the legacy pattern (prior to v2.0.0) for managing org invitations using the the `mongodbatlas_org_invitation` resource. It is intended to show the "before" state for users migrating to the new recommended pattern.

For migration steps, see the [Migration Guide](../../../docs/guides/atlas-user-management.md).
