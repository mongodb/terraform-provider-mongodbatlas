# MongoDB Atlas Provider -- Encryption At Rest using Customer Key Management with Azure
This example shows how to configure encryption at rest with customer managed keys with Azure Key Vault. 

Note: It is possible to configure Atlas Encryption at Rest to communicate with Azure Key Vault using Azure Private Link, ensuring that all traffic between Atlas and Key Vault takes place over Azureâ€™s private network interfaces. Please review `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint` resource for details.

## Dependencies

* Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider
* A MongoDB Atlas account 
* A Microsoft Azure account

## Usage

**1\. Provide the appropriate values for the input variables.**

- `atlas_public_key`: The public API key for MongoDB Atlas
- `atlas_private_key`: The private API key for MongoDB Atlas
- `atlas_project_id`: Atlas Project ID
- `azure_subscription_id`: Azure ID that identifies your Azure subscription
- `azure_client_id`: Azure ID identifies an Azure application associated with your Azure Active Directory tenant
- `azure_client_secret`: Secret associated to the Azure application
- `azure_tenant_id`: Azure ID  that identifies the Azure Active Directory tenant within your Azure subscription
- `azure_resource_group_name`: Name of the Azure resource group that contains your Azure Key Vault
- `azure_key_vault_name`: Unique string that identifies the Azure Key Vault that contains your key
- `azure_key_identifier`: Web address with a unique key that identifies for your Azure Key Vault

**NOTE**: The Azure application (associated to `azure_client_id`) must have the following permissions associated to the Azure Key Vault (`azure_key_vault_name`):
- GET (Key Management Operation), ENCRYPT (Cryptographic Operation) and DECRYPT (Cryptographic Operation) policy permissions.
- A `Key Vault Reader` role.

**2\. Review the Terraform plan.**

Execute the following command and ensure you are happy with the plan.

``` bash
$ terraform plan
```
This project currently supports the following deployments:

- Configure encryption at rest in an existing project using a custom Azure Key.

**3\. Execute the Terraform apply.**

Now execute the plan to provision the resources.

``` bash
$ terraform apply
```

**4\. Destroy the resources.**

When you have finished your testing, ensure you destroy the resources to avoid unnecessary Atlas charges.

``` bash
$ terraform destroy
```
