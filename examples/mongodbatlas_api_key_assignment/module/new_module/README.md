# Module Example: API Key Project Assignment

This example demonstrates how to use the `mongodbatlas_api_key_project_assignment` resource within a Terraform module. It shows how to assign an organization API key to a project using module inputs.

If you are migrating from the legacy `mongodbatlas_project_api_key` resource, please see the [Migration Guide](../../../docs/guides/project-api-key-migration.md#does-this-work-for-modules) for important instructions on importing existing resources into your module-managed configuration.
