# Old Module Example: Project API Key (Legacy)

This example demonstrates the legacy pattern for assigning API keys to projects using the `mongodbatlas_project_api_key` resource. It is intended to show the "before" state for users migrating to the new recommended pattern.

For migration steps, see the [Migration Guide](../../../docs/guides/project-api-key-migration.md#module-migration-example).
