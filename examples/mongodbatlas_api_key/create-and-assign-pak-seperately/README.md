# MongoDB Atlas Provider -- Create and Assign PAK Separately (Deprecated) 

Note this functionality has been deprecated and will be removed in v1.12.0. Instead suggest see examples for Create and Assign PAK Together + Create and Assign PAK to Multiple Projects.
This example creates an organization API Key and access list, showing how to attach a CIDR block.

Variables Required to be set:
- `project_id`: ID of the Atlas project
- `org_id`: ID of Atlas organization
- `public_key`: Atlas public key
- `private_key`: Atlas  private key

In this example, we will set up an organization API key and attach an access list to it.
