# Example - GCP and MongoDB Atlas Private Endpoint

This project aims to provide an example of setting up GCP Private Service Connect with MongoDB Atlas.


## Dependencies

* Terraform v0.13+
* Google Cloud account
* MongoDB Atlas account

```
Terraform v0.13.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google
+ provider registry.terraform.io/terraform-providers/mongodbatlas
```

## Usage

**1\. Ensure your Google credentials are set up.**

1. Install the GCloud SDK by following the steps from the [official GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2. Run the command `gcloud init` and authenticate with GCP.
3. Once authenticated you will need to select a project to use. After you select a project a success message will appear, see the example below. You are then ready to proceed.
```
â‡’  gcloud init
You are logged in as: [user@example.com].

Pick cloud project to use:
 [1] project1
 [2] project2
...

Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list item): 1

Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!

```
**2\. TFVARS**

Now create **terraform.tfvars** file with all the variable values and make sure **not to commit it**.

An existing cluster on the project can optionally be linked via the `cluster_name` variable.
If included, the gcp connection string to the cluster will be output.

**3\. Review the Terraform plan.**

Execute the below command and ensure you are happy with the plan.

``` bash
$ terraform plan
```
This project currently does the below deployments:

- MongoDB Atlas GCP Private Endpoint
- Google resource Compute Network, SubNetwork, Address and Forwarding Rule
- Google Private Service Connect (PSC)-MongoDB Private Link

**4\. Execute the Terraform apply.**

Now execute the plan to provision the GCP resources.

``` bash
$ terraform apply
```

**5\. Destroy the resources.**

Once you are finished your testing, ensure you destroy the resources to avoid unnecessary GCP and Atlas charges.

``` bash
$ terraform destroy
```
