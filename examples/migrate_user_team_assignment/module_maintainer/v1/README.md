# Old Module Example: Cloud User Team (Legacy)

This example demonstrates the legacy pattern (prior to v2.0.0) for assigning users to a team using the `mongodbatlas_team` resource. It is intended to show the "before" state for users migrating to the new recommended pattern.

For migration steps, see the [Migration Guide](../../../docs/guides/cloud_user_team_assignment_migration_guide.md).
