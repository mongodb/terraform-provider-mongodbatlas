# Resource: mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest

`mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest` allows management of Encryption at Rest for an Atlas project using Customer Key Management configuration. The following providers are supported:
- [Amazon Web Services Key Management Service](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-aws-kms/#security-aws-kms)
- [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-azure-kms/#security-azure-kms)
- [Google Cloud KMS](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-gcp-kms/#security-gcp-kms)

The [encryption at rest Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-mongodbatlas-modules/encryption-at-rest/mongodbatlas/latest) makes use of this resource and simplifies its use. It is currently limited to AWS KMS.

Atlas does not automatically rotate user-managed encryption keys. Defer to your preferred Encryption at Rest provider’s documentation and guidance for best practices on key rotation. Atlas automatically creates a 90-day key rotation alert when you configure Encryption at Rest using your Key Management in an Atlas project.

See [Encryption at Rest](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-kms-encryption/index.html) for more information, including prerequisites and restrictions.

~> **IMPORTANT** Atlas encrypts all cluster storage and snapshot volumes, securing all cluster data on disk: a concept known as encryption at rest, by default.

~> **IMPORTANT** Atlas limits this feature to dedicated cluster tiers of M10 and greater. For more information see: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Encryption-at-Rest-using-Customer-Key-Management

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.


-> **IMPORTANT NOTE** To disable the encryption at rest with customer key management for a project all existing clusters in the project must first either have encryption at rest for the provider set to none, e.g. `encryption_at_rest_provider = "NONE"`, or be deleted.

## Enabling Encryption at Rest for existing Atlas cluster

After configuring at least one key management provider for an Atlas project, Project Owners can enable customer key management for each Atlas cluster for which they require encryption. For clusters defined in terraform, the [`encryption_at_rest_provider` attribute](advanced_cluster#encryption_at_rest_provider) can be used in both `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` and `mongodbatlas_cluster` resources. The key management provider does not have to match the cluster cloud service provider.

Please reference [Enable Customer Key Management for an Atlas Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-kms-encryption/#enable-customer-key-management-for-an-service-cluster) documentation for additional considerations.


## Example Usages

### Configuring encryption at rest using customer key management in AWS
The configuration of encryption at rest with customer key management, `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest`, needs to be completed before a cluster is created in the project. Force this wait by using an implicit dependency via `project_id` as shown in the example below.

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_setup" "setup_only" {
  project_id    = var.atlas_project_id
  provider_name = "AWS"
}

resource "mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_authorization" "auth_role" {
  project_id = var.atlas_project_id
  role_id    = mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_setup.setup_only.role_id

  aws {
    iam_assumed_role_arn = aws_iam_role.test_role.arn
  }
}

resource "mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest" "test" {
  project_id = var.atlas_project_id

  aws_kms_config {
    enabled                = true
    customer_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.kms_key.id
    region                 = var.atlas_region
    role_id                = mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_authorization.auth_role.role_id
  }
}

resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "cluster" {
  project_id                  = mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest.test.project_id
  name                        = "MyCluster"
  cluster_type                = "REPLICASET"
  backup_enabled              = true
  encryption_at_rest_provider = "AWS"

  replication_specs {
    region_configs {
      priority      = 7
      provider_name = "AWS"
      region_name   = "US_EAST_1"
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
      }
    }
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest" "test" {
  project_id = mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest.test.project_id
}

output "is_aws_kms_encryption_at_rest_valid" {
  value = data.mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest.test.aws_kms_config.valid
}
```

**NOTE**  If using the two resources path for cloud provider access, `cloud_provider_access_setup` and `cloud_provider_access_authorization`, you may need to define a `depends_on` statement for these two resources, because terraform is not able to infer the dependency.

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest" "default" {
  (...)
  depends_on = [mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_setup.<resource_name>, mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_authorization.<resource_name>]
}
```

### Configuring encryption at rest using customer key management in Azure
```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest" "test" {
  project_id = var.atlas_project_id

  azure_key_vault_config {
    enabled           = true
    azure_environment = "AZURE"

    tenant_id       = var.azure_tenant_id
    subscription_id = var.azure_subscription_id
    client_id       = var.azure_client_id
    secret          = var.azure_client_secret

    resource_group_name = var.azure_resource_group_name
    key_vault_name      = var.azure_key_vault_name
    key_identifier      = var.azure_key_identifier
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest" "test" {
  project_id = mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest.test.project_id
}

output "is_azure_encryption_at_rest_valid" {
  value = data.mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest.test.azure_key_vault_config.valid
}
```

#### Manage Customer Keys with Azure Key Vault Over Private Endpoints
It is possible to configure Atlas Encryption at Rest to communicate with Azure Key Vault using Azure Private Link, ensuring that all traffic between Atlas and Key Vault takes place over Azure’s private network interfaces. This requires enabling `azure_key_vault_config.require_private_networking` attribute, together with the configuration of `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint` resource. 

Please review [`mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint` resource documentation](encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint) and [complete example](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/tree/master/examples/mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint/azure) for details on this functionality.
