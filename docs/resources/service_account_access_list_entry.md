# Resource: mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry

`mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry` provides a Service Account Access List entry resource. The resource lets you create, delete, and import a Service Account Access List entry for the specified Organization.

~> **IMPORTANT:** When you remove an entry from the access list, existing connections from the removed address(es) may remain open for a variable amount of time. How much time passes before Atlas closes the connection depends on several factors, including how the connection was established, the particular behavior of the application or driver using the address, and the connection protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP). This is particularly important to consider when changing an existing IP address or CIDR block as they cannot be updated via the Provider, hence a change will force the destruction and recreation of entries.

~> **IMPORTANT WARNING:** Managing Service Accounts with Terraform **exposes sensitive organizational secrets** in Terraform's state. We suggest following [Terraform's best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usages

```terraform

  org_id                     = var.org_id
  name                       = "example-service-account"
  description                = "Example Service Account"
  roles                      = ["ORG_READ_ONLY"]
  secret_expires_after_hours = 2160 # 90 days
}

# Add IP Access List Entry to Service Account using CIDR Block
resource "mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry" "cidr" {
  org_id     = var.org_id
  client_id  = mongodbatlas_service_account.this.client_id
  cidr_block = "1.2.3.4/32"
}

# Add IP Access List Entry to Service Account using IP Address
resource "mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry" "ip" {
  org_id     = var.org_id
  client_id  = mongodbatlas_service_account.this.client_id
  ip_address = "2.3.4.5"
}

# Data source to read a single Service Account Access List entry
data "mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry" "this" {
  org_id     = mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry.cidr.org_id
  client_id  = mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry.cidr.client_id
  cidr_block = mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry.cidr.cidr_block
}

output "access_list_entry_cidr_block" {
  value = data.mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry.this.cidr_block
}

# Data source to read all Service Account Access List entries
data "mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entries" "this" {
  org_id    = mongodbatlas_service_account.this.org_id
  client_id = mongodbatlas_service_account.this.client_id

  depends_on = [
    mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry.cidr,
    mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry.ip
  ]
}

output "all_access_list_entries" {

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Date the entry was added to the access list. This attribute expresses its value in the ISO 8601 timestamp format in UTC.
- `last_used_address` (String) Network address that issued the most recent request to the API.
- `last_used_at` (String) Date when the API received the most recent request that originated from this network address.
- `request_count` (Number) The number of requests that has originated from this network address.

## Import

Service Account Access List entries can be imported using the `org_id`, `client_id` and `cidr_block` or `ip_address`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_service_account_access_list_entry.test 5d0f1f74cf09a29120e123cd-mdb_sa_id_1234567890abcdef12345678-10.242.88.0/21
