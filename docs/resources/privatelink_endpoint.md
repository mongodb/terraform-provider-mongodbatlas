# Resource: mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint

`mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint` provides a Private Endpoint resource. This represents a [Private Endpoint Service](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-private-endpoint/#private-endpoint-concepts) that can be created in an Atlas project.

~> **IMPORTANT:** This resource creates a Private Endpoint *Service* in MongoDB Atlas. The endpoint itself is created in your cloud provider using the information returned by this resource. The complementary resource `mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service` is used to link your cloud provider's endpoint to the Atlas service.

The [private link Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-mongodbatlas-modules/private-endpoint/mongodbatlas/latest) makes use of this resource and simplifies its use.

-> **NOTE:** You must have Organization Owner or Project Owner role. A network container is created for a private endpoint if one does not yet exist in the project. Before configuring a private endpoint for a new region, review the [Multi-Region Private Endpoints](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/troubleshoot-private-endpoints/#multi-region-private-endpoints) troubleshooting documentation.

~> **IMPORTANT:** For GCP, MongoDB encourages customers to use the port-mapped architecture by setting `port_mapping_enabled = true`. This architecture uses a single set of resources to support up to 150 nodes. The legacy architecture requires dedicated resources for each Atlas node, which can lead to IP address exhaustion. For migration guidance, see the [GCP Private Service Connect to Port-Mapped Architecture](../guides/gcp-privatelink-port-mapping-migration.md).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint" "this" {
  project_id    = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  provider_name = "AWS" # or "AZURE" or "GCP"
  region        = "US_EAST_1" # Any valid AWS, Azure, or GCP region
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String)
- `provider_name` (String)
- `region` (String)

### Optional

- `delete_on_create_timeout` (Boolean) Indicates whether to delete the resource being created if a timeout is reached when waiting for completion. When set to `true` and timeout occurs, it triggers the deletion and returns immediately without waiting for deletion to complete. When set to `false`, the timeout will not trigger resource deletion. If you suspect a transient error when the value is `true`, wait before retrying to allow resource deletion to finish. Default is `true`.
- `port_mapping_enabled` (Boolean) Flag that indicates whether this resource uses GCP port-mapping. When `true`, it uses the port-mapped architecture. When `false` or unset, it uses the GCP legacy private endpoint architecture. Only applicable for GCP provider.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `endpoint_group_names` (List of String)
- `endpoint_service_name` (String)
- `error_message` (String)
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `interface_endpoints` (List of String)
- `private_endpoints` (List of String)
- `private_link_id` (String)
- `private_link_service_name` (String)
- `private_link_service_resource_id` (String)
- `region_name` (String)
- `service_attachment_names` (List of String)
- `status` (String)

## Import
Private Endpoint Service can be imported using project ID, private link ID, provider name and region, in the format `{project_id}-{private_link_id}-{provider_name}-{region}`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.this 1112222b3bf99403840e8934-3242342343112-AWS-us-east-1
