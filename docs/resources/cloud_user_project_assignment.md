# Resource: mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment

`mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment` provides a Cloud User Project Assignment resource. It lets you manage the association between a cloud user and a project, enabling you to import, assign, remove, or update the user's membership.

->**NOTE**Users with pending invitations created using the deprecated `mongodbatlas_project_invitation` resource or via the deprecated [Invite One MongoDB Cloud User to One Project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-getorganizationuser#tag/Projects/operation/createProjectInvitation)
endpoint cannot be managed with this resource. See [MongoDB Atlas API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-getprojectteam) for details.
To manage such users with this resource, refer to our [migration guide]<link-to-migration-guide>.
