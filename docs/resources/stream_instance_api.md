# Resource: mongodbatlas_stream_instance_api

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cloud_provider` (String) Label that identifies the cloud service provider where MongoDB Cloud performs stream processing. Currently, this parameter only supports AWS and AZURE.
- `group_id` (String) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.

**NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your group id is the same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id remains the same. The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term groups.
- `region` (String) Name of the cloud provider region hosting Atlas Stream Processing.

### Optional

- `data_process_region` (Attributes) Information about the cloud provider region in which MongoDB Cloud processes the stream. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data_process_region))
- `name` (String) Human-readable label that identifies the stream instance.
- `sample_connections` (Attributes) Sample connections to add to SPI. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sample_connections))
- `stream_config` (Attributes) Configuration options for an Atlas Stream Processing Instance. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stream_config))

### Read-Only

- `_id` (String) Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the project.
- `connections` (Attributes List) List of connections configured in the stream instance. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--connections))
- `hostnames` (List of String) List that contains the hostnames assigned to the stream instance.
- `links` (Attributes List) List of one or more Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that point to API sub-resources, related API resources, or both. RFC 5988 outlines these relationships. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--links))
