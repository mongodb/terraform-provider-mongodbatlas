# Migration Guide: Advanced Cluster New Sharding Schema

**Objective**: Use this guide to migrate your existing `advanced_cluster` configurations to the new sharding schema introduced in version 1.18.0. The new sharding schema allows you to scale shards independently. Exiting sharding configurations continue to work, although the software issues deprecation messages if you use the legacy schema.

## Overview of schema changes

`replication_specs` attribute now represents each individual cluster's shard with a unique replication spec element.
When you use the new sharding schema, the schema no longer uses the existing attribute `num_shards`, and instead the number of shards are defined by the number of `replication_specs` elements.

### Migrate advanced_cluster type `SHARDED`

Consider the following configuration of a `SHARDED` cluster using the deprecated `num_shards`:
```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
  project_id   = var.project_id
  name         = "SymmetricShardedCluster"
  cluster_type = "SHARDED"

  replication_specs {
    # deprecation warning will be encoutered for using num_shards
    num_shards = 2 
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M30"
        disk_iops = 3000
        node_count    = 3
      }
      provider_name = "AWS"
      priority      = 7
      region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }
}
```

In order to update our configuration to the new schema, we will remove the use of `num_shards` and add a new identical `replication_specs` element for each shard. Note that these 2 changes must be done at the same time.

```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
  project_id   = var.project_id
  name         = "SymmetricShardedCluster"
  cluster_type = "SHARDED"

  replication_specs { # first shard
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M30"
        disk_iops = 3000
        node_count    = 3
      }
      provider_name = "AWS"
      priority      = 7
      region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }

  replication_specs { # second shard
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M30"
        disk_iops = 3000
        node_count    = 3
      }
      provider_name = "AWS"
      priority      = 7
      region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }
}
```

This updated configuration will trigger a Terraform update plan. However, the underlying cluster will not face any changes after the `apply` command, as both configurations represent a sharded cluster composed of two shards.

### Migrate advanced_cluster type `GEOSHARDED`

Consider the following configuration of a `GEOSHARDED` cluster using the deprecated `num_shards`:

```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
  project_id = var.project_id
  name = "GeoShardedCluster"
  cluster_type   = "GEOSHARDED"

  replication_specs {
    zone_name  = "zone n1"
    num_shards = 2
    region_configs {
    electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
    }
    provider_name = "AWS"
    priority      = 7
    region_name   = "US_EAST_1"
    }
  }

  replication_specs {
    zone_name  = "zone n2"
    num_shards = 2

    region_configs {
    electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
    }
    provider_name = "AWS"
    priority      = 7
    region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }
}
```

In order to update our configuration to the new schema, we will remove the use of `num_shards` and add a new identical `replication_specs` element for each shard. Note that these two changes must be done at the same time.

```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
  project_id = var.project_id
  name = "GeoShardedCluster"
  cluster_type   = "GEOSHARDED"

  replication_specs { # first shard for zone n1
    zone_name  = "zone n1"
    region_configs {
    electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
    }
    provider_name = "AWS"
    priority      = 7
    region_name   = "US_EAST_1"
    }
  }

  replication_specs { # second shard for zone n1
    zone_name  = "zone n1"
    region_configs {
    electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
    }
    provider_name = "AWS"
    priority      = 7
    region_name   = "US_EAST_1"
    }
  }

  replication_specs { # first shard for zone n2
    zone_name  = "zone n2"
    region_configs {
    electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
    }
    provider_name = "AWS"
    priority      = 7
    region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }

  replication_specs { # second shard for zone n2
    zone_name  = "zone n2"
    region_configs {
    electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
    }
    provider_name = "AWS"
    priority      = 7
    region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }
}
```



This updated configuration triggers a Terraform update plan. However, the underlying cluster will not face any changes after the `apply` command, as both configurations represent a geo sharded cluster with two zones and two shards in each one.

### Migrate advanced_cluster type `REPLICASET`

To learn more, see the documentation on [transitioning from a replicaset to a sharded cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/scale-cluster/#convert-a-replica-set-to-a-sharded-cluster).

Consider the following replica set configuration:
```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
    project_id   = var.project_id
    name         = "ReplicaSetTransition"
    cluster_type = "REPLICASET"

    replication_specs {
        region_configs {
            electable_specs {
                instance_size = "M10"
                node_count    = 3
            }
            provider_name = "AZURE"
            priority      = 7
            region_name   = "US_EAST"
        }
    }
}
```

To transition a replica set to sharded cluster 2 separate updates must be applied. First, update the `cluster_type` to SHARDED, and apply this change to the cluster.

```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
    project_id   = var.project_id
    name         = "ReplicaSetTransition"
    cluster_type = "SHARDED"

    replication_specs {
        region_configs {
            electable_specs {
                instance_size = "M10"
                node_count    = 3
            }
            provider_name = "AZURE"
            priority      = 7
            region_name   = "US_EAST"
        }
    }
}
```

Once the cluster type is adjusted accordingly, we can proceed to add a new shard using the new schema:

```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
    project_id   = var.project_id
    name         = "ReplicaSetTransition"
    cluster_type = "SHARDED"

    replication_specs { # first shard
        region_configs {
            electable_specs {
                instance_size = "M10"
                node_count    = 3
            }
            provider_name = "AZURE"
            priority      = 7
            region_name   = "US_EAST"
        }
    }

    replication_specs { # second shard
        region_configs {
            electable_specs {
                instance_size = "M10"
                node_count    = 3
            }
            provider_name = "AZURE"
            priority      = 7
            region_name   = "US_EAST"
        }
    }
}
```

### Use Independent Shard Scaling 

Use the new sharding schema. Each shard must be represented with a unique replication_specs element and `num_shards` must not be used, as illustrated in the following example.

```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
  project_id   = var.project_id
  name         = "ShardedCluster"
  cluster_type = "SHARDED"

  replication_specs { # first shard
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M30"
        node_count    = 3
      }
      provider_name = "AWS"
      priority      = 7
      region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }

  replication_specs { # second shard
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M30"
        node_count    = 3
      }
      provider_name = "AWS"
      priority      = 7
      region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }
}
```

With each shard's `replication_specs` defined independently, we can now define distinct `instance_size`, and `disk_iops` (only for AWS) values for each shard in the cluster. In the following example, we define an upgraded instance size of M40 only for the first shard in the cluster.

Consider reviewing the Metrics Dashboard in the MongoDB Atlas UI (e.g. https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/<PROJECT-ID>#/clusters/detail/ShardedCluster) for insight into how each shard within your cluster is currently performing, which will inform any shard-specific resource allocation changes you might require.

```
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "test" {
  project_id   = var.project_id
  name         = "ShardedCluster"
  cluster_type = "SHARDED"

  replication_specs { # first shard upgraded to M40
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M40"
        node_count    = 3
      }
      provider_name = "AWS"
      priority      = 7
      region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }

  replication_specs { # second shard preserves M30
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M30"
        node_count    = 3
      }
      provider_name = "AWS"
      priority      = 7
      region_name   = "EU_WEST_1"
    }
  }
}
```

-> **NOTE:** For any cluster leveraging the new schema and defining independently scaled shards, users should also update corresponding `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule` resource & data sources. This involves updating any existing Terraform configurations of the resource to use `copy_settings.#.zone_id` instead of `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id`. This is needed as `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource and data source will no longer have `replication_specs.#.id` present when shards are scaled independently. To learn more, review the [1.18.0 Migration Guide](1.18.0-upgrade-guide.md#transition-cloud-backup-schedules-for-clusters-to-use-zones).
