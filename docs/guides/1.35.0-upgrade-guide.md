# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.35.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.35.0 introduces the following new features and fixes:

## New Resources, Data Sources, and Features

- `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` (preview provider 2.0.0) and `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resources now support the new `delete_on_create_timeout` attribute. This flag indicates whether to delete the cluster if the cluster creation times out. The default is `false`. To learn more, see the [mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/advanced_cluster) resource documentation.

- `mongodbatlas_search_deployment` resource now supports the new `delete_on_create_timeout` attribute. This flag indicates whether to delete the search deployment if the search deployment creation times out. The default is `false`. To learn more, see the [mongodbatlas_search_deployment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/search_deployment) resource documentation.

## Bug Fixes

- `mongodbatlas_private_endpoint_regional_mode` resource update wait time has been increased so cluster connection strings are updated. This improves reliability when updating regional mode private endpoints.
