# Migration Guide: Cluster to Advanced Cluster

**Objective**: This guide explains how to replace the `mongodbatlas_cluster` resource with the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource. The data source(s) migration only requires [output changes](#output-changes) as data sources only read clusters.

## Main Changes Between `mongodbatlas_cluster` and `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster`

1. Replication Spec Configuration: Supports different node types (electable, analytics, read_only) where hardware configuration can differ between node types. `regions_config` is renamed to `region_configs`.
2. Provider Settings: Moved from the top level to the replication spec allowing you to create multi-cloud clusters.
3. Auto Scaling: Moved from the top level to the replication spec allowing you to scale replication specs individually.
4. Backup Configuration: Renamed from `cloud_backup` to `backup_enabled`.
5. See the [Migration Guide: Advanced Cluster New Sharding Configurations](advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema#migration-sharded) for changes to `num_shards` and the new `zone_id`.

### Example 1: Old Configuration (`mongodbatlas_cluster`)

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_cluster" "this" {
  project_id   = var.project_id
  name         = "legacy-cluster"
  cluster_type = "REPLICASET"

  provider_instance_size_name = "M10" # 1 Replication Spec Configuration
  provider_name               = "AWS" # 2 Provider Settings

  auto_scaling_disk_gb_enabled = true # 3 Auto Scaling
  cloud_backup                 = true # 4 Backup Configuration

  replication_specs {
    num_shards = 1
    regions_config {
      region_name     = "US_EAST_1"
      priority        = 7
      electable_nodes = 3 # 1 Replication Spec Configuration
      analytics_nodes = 1 # 1 Replication Spec Configuration
      read_only_nodes = 0 # 1 Replication Spec Configuration
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2: New Configuration (`mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster`)

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "this" {
  project_id     = var.project_id
  name           = "advanced-cluster"
  cluster_type   = "REPLICASET"
  backup_enabled = true # 4 Backup Configuration

  replication_specs {
    region_configs {
      auto_scaling { # 3 Auto Scaling
        disk_gb_enabled = true
      }
      region_name   = "US_EAST_1"
      priority      = 7
      provider_name = "AWS" # 2 Provider Settings

      electable_specs { # 1 Replication Spec Configuration
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 3
      }
      analytics_specs { # 1 Replication Spec Configuration
        instance_size = "M10"
        node_count    = 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Output Changes

- Connection strings:
  - Before: `srv_address`, `mongo_uri`, `mongo_uri_with_options` and `mongo_uri_updated` attributes were available.
  - After: They're not available anymore, use attributes in `connection_strings` instead.
- `container_id`:
  - Before: `mongodbatlas_cluster.this.replication_specs[0].container_id` was a flat string, such as: `669644ae01bf814e3d25b963`
  - After: `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.this.replication_specs[0].container_id` is a map, such as: `{"AWS:US_EAST_1": "669644ae01bf814e3d25b963"}`
  - If you have a single region you can access the `container_id` directly with: `one(values(mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.this.replication_specs[0].container_id))`
- `snapshot_backup_policy`:
  - Before: It was deprecated.
  - After: Use `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule` resource instead.

## Best Practices Before Migrating

Before doing any migration create a backup of your [Terraform state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/state).

## Migration using Moved block (recommended)

The [moved block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/moved) is a Terraform feature that allows to move between resource types. It's conceptually similar to do `removed` and `import` but it's more convenient as it's done in one step, and can be used in `modules`. This is our recommended method to migrate from `mongodbatlas_cluster` to `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster`.

 The main requirements are:
 - Terraform version 1.8 or later is required, more info in the [State Move doc](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/state-move).
 - Preview for MongoDB Atlas Provider v2 of `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` is required, it is enabled by setting environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_PREVIEW_PROVIDER_V2_ADVANCED_CLUSTER=true`. More information can be found in the [resource doc](../resources/advanced_cluster%2520%2528preview%2520provider%2520v2%2529) and the [Migration Guide: Advanced Cluster Preview Provider v2](advanced-cluster-preview-provider-v2).

We recommend that you follow another migration process only if you can't meet these requirements.

The process to migrate from `mongodbatlas_cluster` to `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` using the `moved` block is as follows:
- Before starting, run `terraform plan` to make sure that there are no planned changes.
- Add the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource definition. 
  - Make sure environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_PREVIEW_PROVIDER_V2_ADVANCED_CLUSTER=true` is set in order to use the Preview for MongoDB Atlas Provider v2. You can also define the environment variable in your local development environment so your tools can use the new format and help you with linting and auto-completion.
  - The [Atlas CLI plugin](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/atlas-cli-plugin-terraform) can be used to generate the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource definition. This is the recommended method as it will generate a clean configuration keeping the original Terraform expressions.
  - Alternatively, you can use the `terraform plan -generate-config-out=adv_cluster.tf` method to create the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource definition, or create it manually.
- Comment out or delete the `mongodbatlas_cluster` resource definition.
- Add the `moved` block to your configuration file, e.g.:
```terraform
moved {
  from = mongodbatlas_cluster.this
  to   = mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.this
}
```
- Run `terraform plan` and make sure that there are no planned changes, only the moved should be shown. **Important**: Don't apply until planning shows only the moved changes. If it shows other changes, you will need to keep updating the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` configuration until it matches the original `mongodbatlas_cluster` configuration.
- Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes. The `mongodbatlas_cluster` resource will be removed from the Terraform state and the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource will be added.
- At this moment you can delete the `moved` block from your configuration file, although it's recommended to keep it to help track the migrations.

You can find full-detailed examples in [migrate_cluster_to_advanced_cluster](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/tree/master/examples/migrate_cluster_to_advanced_cluster).

## Migration using `terraform plan -generate-config-out=adv_cluster.tf`

This method uses only [Terraform native tools](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import/generating-configuration) and is ideal if you:
1. Have an existing cluster without any Terraform configuration and want to manage your cluster with Terraform.
2. Have existing `mongodbatlas_cluster` resource(s) and don't want to use an external script for migrating.

**Note**: We recommend the `moved block` method as it's more convenient and less error-prone. If you continue with this method, you should still use the Preview for MongoDB Atlas Provider v2 by setting the environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_PREVIEW_PROVIDER_V2_ADVANCED_CLUSTER=true` to avoid having to migrate again in the future.

### Procedure

1. Find the import IDs of the clusters you want to migrate: `{PROJECT_ID}-{CLUSTER_NAME}`, such as `664619d870c247237f4b86a6-legacy-cluster`
2. Add an import block per cluster to one of your `.tf` files:
  ```terraform
  import {
    to = mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.this
    id = "664619d870c247237f4b86a6-legacy-cluster" # from step 1
  }
  ```
3. Run `terraform plan -generate-config-out=adv_cluster.tf`. This should generate a `adv_cluster.tf` file and display a message similar to `Plan: 1 to import, 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy`:
  ```terraform
  resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "this" {
    # ... most attributes are removed for readability of this guide
    # ....
    backup_enabled                       = true
    cluster_type                         = "REPLICASET"
    disk_size_gb                         = 10
    name                                 = "legacy-cluster"
    project_id                           = "664619d870c247237f4b86a6"
    state_name                           = "IDLE"
    termination_protection_enabled       = false
    version_release_system               = "LTS"

    advanced_configuration {
      default_read_concern                 = null
      default_write_concern                = null
      fail_index_key_too_long              = false
      javascript_enabled                   = true
      minimum_enabled_tls_protocol         = "TLS1_2"
      no_table_scan                        = false
      oplog_min_retention_hours            = 0
      oplog_size_mb                        = 0
      sample_refresh_interval_bi_connector = 0
      sample_size_bi_connector             = 0
      transaction_lifetime_limit_seconds   = 0
    }

    replication_specs {
      container_id = {
        "AWS:US_EAST_1" = "669644ae01bf814e3d25b963"
      }
      id         = "66978026668b7619f6f48cf2"
      zone_name  = "ZoneName managed by Terraform"

      region_configs {
        priority              = 7
        provider_name         = "AWS"
        region_name           = "US_EAST_1"

        auto_scaling {
          compute_enabled            = false
          compute_max_instance_size  = null
          compute_min_instance_size  = null
          compute_scale_down_enabled = false
          disk_gb_enabled            = false
        }

        electable_specs {
          disk_iops       = 3000
          ebs_volume_type = null
          instance_size   = "M10"
          node_count      = 3
        }
        analytics_specs {
          disk_iops       = 3000
          ebs_volume_type = null
          instance_size   = "M10"
          node_count      = 1
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
4. Run `terraform apply`. You should see the resource(s) imported: `Apply complete! Resources: 1 imported, 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.`
5. Remove the "default" fields. Many fields of this resource are optional. Look for fields with a `null` or `0` value or blocks you didn't specify before, for example:
   - `advanced_configuration`
   - `connection_strings`
   - `cluster_id`
   - `bi_connector_config`
6. Re-use existing [Terraform expressions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions). All fields in the generated configuration will have static values. Look in your previous configuration for:
   - variables, for example: `var.project_id`
   - Terraform keywords, for example: `for_each`, `count`, and `depends_on`
7. Re-run `terraform apply` to ensure you have no planned changes: `No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.`
8. Update the references from your previous cluster resource: `mongodbatlas_cluster.this.XXXX` to the new `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.this.XXX`.
   - Double check [output-changes](#output-changes) to ensure the underlying configuration stays unchanged.
9.  Replace your existing clusters with the ones from `adv_cluster.tf` and run `terraform state rm mongodbatlas_cluster.this`. Without this step, Terraform will create a plan to delete your existing cluster.
1.  Remove the import block created in step 2.
2.  Re-run `terraform apply` to ensure you have no planned changes: `No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.`

### Terraform Actions
Using the `project_id` and `cluster.name`, Terraform imports your cluster and uses the new `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` schema to generate a configuration file. This file includes all configurable values in the schema, but none of the previous configuration defined for your `mongodbatlas_cluster`. Therefore, the new configuration will likely be a lot more verbose and contain none of your original [Terraform expressions.](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions)
