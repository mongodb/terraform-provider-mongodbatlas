# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.41.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.41.0 introduces the following new features and fixes:

## New Resources, Data Sources, and Features

- Adds support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as a cloud provider in the `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_setup` resource and data source, and in the `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_authorization` resource.
- The `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest` resource and data source now support the `role_id` attribute in `google_cloud_kms_config`, providing a new authentication option for Google Cloud KMS. To migrate from service account keys to role-based authentication, see the [GCP Role-based Migration Guide](./encryption-at-rest-gcp-role-based-migration.md).
- Changes to the `project_id` or `role_id` attributes in the `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_access_authorization` resource will now result in the destruction and recreation of the authorization resource. This ensures proper configuration updates but may cause temporary service interruption. Plan your updates accordingly and review your resource dependencies before applying changes.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes a "Value Conversion Error" that occurred when `replication_specs` are unknown in the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` 2.0 preview resource, improving configuration stability during cluster creation and updates.
