# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.19.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.19.0 has a number of new and exciting features.

**New Resources, Data Sources, and Features:**
- You can now [manage customer keys from Azure Key Vault over Private Endpoints](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/azure-kms-over-private-endpoint/#manage-customer-keys-with-azure-key-vault-over-private-endpoints) to further encrypt your data at rest in Atlas with the new `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint` resource and data sources in conjunction with the existing `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest` resource.
    - In order to configure a private endpoint for your Azure Key Vault, the corresponding `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest` resource has to be adjusted by configuring `azure_key_vault_config.require_private_networking` to `true`. This attribute can be updated in place, ensuring the customer-managed keys encryption is never disabled.
    - To learn more, please review `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint` [resource documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint).

- You can now use the new `mongodbatlas_project_ip_addresses` data source that returns the IP addresses in an Atlas project categorized by services.


**Deprecations and removals:**
- `ip_addresses` attribute has been deprecated in `mongodbatlas_project` resource and data sources in favor of the new `mongodbatlas_project_ip_addresses` [data source](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/data-sources/project_ip_addresses).
