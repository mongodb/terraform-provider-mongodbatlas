# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.18.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.18.0 has a number of new and exciting features.

**New Resources, Data Sources, and Features:**

- You can now scale the instance size and disk IOPS independently for each individual shard for sharded and geo-sharded clusters defined with `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster. To learn more, see the [Migration Guide](advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema). As part of these changes, added two new attributes:
    - Use the `replication_specs.*.zone_id` attribute in the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource and data sources to specify the zone of each `replication_specs` object.
  - Use the `use_replication_spec_per_shard` attribute in the `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` data sources to specify whether to obtain `replication_specs` objects for each shard.

**Deprecations:**

- `mongodbatlas_cluster` resource and corresponding data sources are deprecated. Instead, use `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster`. To learn more, see the  [Migration Guide](cluster-to-advanced-cluster-migration-guide).

- Deprecations in `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource and data sources:
  - `replication_specs.*.num_shards`: The `replication_specs` list now supports defining an object for each inidividual shard. Use this new schema instead of the `num_shards` attribute. To learn more, see the [Migration Guide](advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema).
    - `disk_size_gb`: The same attribute is now defined under `replication_specs.*.region_configs.*.(electable_specs|analytics_specs|read_only_specs).disk_size_gb`. Replacing this value doesn't affect the underlying cluster. This change in the value's location aligns this value with the updated API schema and allows for future independent storage size scaling.
    - `replication_specs.*.id`: This attribute was previously used by `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule` resource to identify cluster zones. As of 1.18.0, `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule` resource can reference cluster zones using the new `zone_id` attribute.
    - `advanced_configuration.default_read_concern`: MongoDB 5.0 and later clusters default to `local`. To use a custom read concern level, please refer to your driver documentation.
    - `advanced_configuration.fail_index_key_too_long`: This attribute only applies to older versions of MongoDB (removed in 4.4).
