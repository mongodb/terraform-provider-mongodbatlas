# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.18.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.18.0 has a number of new and exciting features.

**New Resources, Data Sources, and Features:**

- Sharded and geo-sharded clusters defined with `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` are now capable of scaling the instance size and disk IOPS independently for each individual shard. For more details and migration guidelines, please reference [advanced_cluster - Migration to new sharding schema and leveraging Independent Shard Scaling](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema). As part of these changes 2 new attributes have been included:
    - New attribute `replication_specs.*.zone_id` is added in `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource and data sources to enable identifying the zone of each `replication_specs` object.
    - New attribute `use_replication_spec_per_shard` defined in `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` data sources to configure if the users want to obtain `replication_specs` objects for each shard.

**Deprecations:**

- Deprecations in `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` resource and data sources:
    - `replication_specs.*.num_shards`: The `replication_specs` list now supports defining an object for each inidividual shard. This new schema is favoured over using `num_shards` attribute. For more details and migration guidelines, please reference [advanced_cluster - Migration to new sharding schema and leveraging Independent Shard Scaling](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema).
    - `disk_size_gb`: The same attribute is now defined under `replication_specs.*.region_configs.*.(electable_specs|analytics_specs|read_only_specs).disk_size_gb`. Replacing the root value into existing inner specs will have no change in the underlying cluster. The motivation behind this change in location is to align with the new API schema and facilitate new features related to independent storage size scaling in the future.
    - `replication_specs.*.id`: This attribute was being used by `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule` resource to identify cluster zones. As of 1.18.0 `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule` resource can reference cluster zones using the new `zone_id` attribute.
    - `advanced_configuration.default_read_concern`: MongoDB 5.0 and later clusters default to `local`. To use a custom read concern level, please refer to your driver documentation.
    - `advanced_configuration.fail_index_key_too_long`: This attribute only applies to older versions of MongoDB (removed in 4.4).
