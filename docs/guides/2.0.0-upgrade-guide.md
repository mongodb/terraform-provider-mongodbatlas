# MongoDB Atlas Provider 2.0.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

**New Features** 

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 2.0.0 has the following new features:


**Breaking Changes**

- `export` and `auto_export_enabled` are now optional only arguments in `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule `. This facilitates tracking changes in their configurations. 

- `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` attribute has been removed from `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule`. Use `copy_settings.#.zone_id` instead. To learn more, see the [1.18.0 upgrade guide](../guides/1.18.0-upgrade-guide.md#transition-cloud-backup-schedules-for-clusters-to-use-zones).

- `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` and `use_zone_id_for_copy_settings` attributes have been removed from `data.mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule`. Remove any usage of `use_zone_id_for_copy_settings` & replace any references to `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` in your configurations with `copy_settings.#.zone_id`. To learn more, see the [1.18.0 upgrade guide](../guides/1.18.0-upgrade-guide.md#transition-cloud-backup-schedules-for-clusters-to-use-zones).

- `hour_of_day` is now defined as required for `mongodbatlas_maintenance_window`resources. This clarification prevents errors when creating new resources. 

- `actions` now is set as `TypeSet` in `mongodbatlas_custom_db_role`. This prevents plan diffs when reordering the `actions` in `mongodbatlas_custom_db_role` resource.  

- `custom_zone_mapping` attribute has been removed from `mongodbatlas_global_cluster_config` resource & data source. Use `custom_zone_mapping_zone_id` instead (this attribute is not set when a cluster uses independent shard scaling). To learn more, see the [Sharding Configuration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/cluster-to-advanced-cluster-migration-guide).


2.0.0 also includes general improvements, bug fixes, and several key documentation updates. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.
