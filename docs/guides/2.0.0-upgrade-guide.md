# MongoDB Atlas Provider 2.0.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 2.0.0 has X new and exciting feature.

**New Features:**

- `export` and `auto_export_enabled` are now optional only arguments. This facilitates
  tracking changes in their configurations. 

- `hour_of_day` is now defined as required for `mongodbatlas_maintenance_window`resources.
  This clarification prevents errors when creating new resources. 

- `actions` now is set as `TypeSet`. This prevents plan diffs after a reordering your resources.  


2.0.0 also includes general improvements, bug fixes, and several key documentation updates. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.
