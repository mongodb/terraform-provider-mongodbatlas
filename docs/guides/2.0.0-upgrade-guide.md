# MongoDB Atlas Provider 2.0.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 2.0.0 introduces new features, breaking changes, and resource deprecations/removals.

Use this guide to understand whatâ€™s new, what requires migration, and how to update your configurations.

## New Resources, Data Sources, and Features

### New `delete_on_create_timeout` attribute 

Multiple resources now support a `delete_on_create_timeout` boolean attribute that controls cleanup behavior when resource creation times out. When set to `true` (default), the provider will delete the underlying resource if the create operation times out, helping to avoid orphaned resources. This attribute is available in the following resources:
  - `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster`
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_snapshot` 
  - `mongodbatlas_cluster_outage_simulation`
  - `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint`
  - `mongodbatlas_flex_cluster`
  - `mongodbatlas_network_peering`
  - `mongodbatlas_online_archive`
  - `mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint`
  - `mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service`
  - `mongodbatlas_push_based_log_export`
  - `mongodbatlas_search_deployment`
  - `mongodbatlas_stream_processor`

### New Cloud User Assignment Resources 

New user and team management resources that replace deprecated invitation-based workflow:
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_org_assignment` resource and data source: Manages user membership in organizations with structured roles and support for both pending and active memberships.
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment` resource and data source: Manages user membership in projects with automatic invitation handling based on organization membership status.
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_team_assignment` resource and data source: Manages user membership in teams with support for both username and user ID.
  - `mongodbatlas_team_project_assignment` resource and data source: Manages team assignments to projects.

## Breaking Changes

### `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule`
Resource:
  - `export` and `auto_export_enabled` are now optional only arguments. This facilitates tracking changes in their configurations. 
  - `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` attribute has been removed. Use `copy_settings.#.zone_id` instead. To learn more, see the [1.18.0 upgrade guide](../guides/1.18.0-upgrade-guide.md#transition-cloud-backup-schedules-for-clusters-to-use-zones).

Data source:
  - `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` and `use_zone_id_for_copy_settings` attributes have been removed. Remove any usage of `use_zone_id_for_copy_settings` & replace any references to `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` in your configurations with `copy_settings.#.zone_id`. To learn more, see the [1.18.0 upgrade guide](../guides/1.18.0-upgrade-guide.md#transition-cloud-backup-schedules-for-clusters-to-use-zones).


### `mongodbatlas_maintenance_window`
Resource:
  - `hour_of_day` is now required. This clarification prevents errors when creating new resources. 
    
### `mongodbatlas_custom_db_role`
Resource:
  - `actions` now is set as `TypeSet`. This prevents plan diffs when reordering the `actions` in the resource.  
    
### `mongodbatlas_global_cluster_config`
Resource:
  - `custom_zone_mapping` attribute has been removed. Use `custom_zone_mapping_zone_id` instead. To learn more, see the [Sharding Configuration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema).
    
Data source:
  - `custom_zone_mapping` attribute has been removed. Use `custom_zone_mapping_zone_id` instead. To learn more, see the [Sharding Configuration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema).
