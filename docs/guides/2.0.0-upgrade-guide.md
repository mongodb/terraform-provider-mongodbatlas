# MongoDB Atlas Provider 2.0.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

**New Features** 

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 2.0.0 has the following new features:


**Breaking Changes**

- `export` and `auto_export_enabled` are now optional only arguments in `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule `. This facilitates tracking changes in their configurations. 

- `hour_of_day` is now defined as required for `mongodbatlas_maintenance_window`resources. This clarification prevents errors when creating new resources. 

- `actions` now is set as `TypeSet` in `mongodbatlas_custom_db_role`. This prevents plan diffs when reordering the `actions` in `mongodbatlas_custom_db_role` resource.  


2.0.0 also includes general improvements, bug fixes, and several key documentation updates. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.
