# MongoDB Atlas Provider 2.0.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 2.0.0 has the following new features and breaking changes:

## New Resources, Data Sources, and Features

- **New `delete_on_create_timeout` attribute**: Multiple resources now support a `delete_on_create_timeout` boolean attribute that controls cleanup behavior when resource creation times out. When set to `true` (default), the provider will delete the underlying resource if the create operation times out, helping to avoid orphaned resources. This attribute is available in the following resources:
  - `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster`
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_snapshot` 
  - `mongodbatlas_cluster_outage_simulation`
  - `mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint`
  - `mongodbatlas_flex_cluster`
  - `mongodbatlas_network_peering`
  - `mongodbatlas_online_archive`
  - `mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint`
  - `mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service`
  - `mongodbatlas_push_based_log_export`
  - `mongodbatlas_search_deployment`
  - `mongodbatlas_stream_processor`

- **New Cloud User Assignment Resources**: User and team management resources that replace deprecated invitation-based workflow:
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_org_assignment` resource and data source: Manages user membership in organizations with structured roles and support for both pending and active memberships
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment` resource and data source: Manages user membership in projects with automatic invitation handling based on organization membership status
  - `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_team_assignment` resource and data source: Manages user membership in teams with support for both username and user ID
  - `mongodbatlas_team_project_assignment` resource and data source: Manages team assignments to projects, replacing the deprecated `teams` attribute in `mongodbatlas_project` resource

## Breaking Changes

- `export` and `auto_export_enabled` are now optional only arguments in `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule `. This facilitates tracking changes in their configurations. 

- `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` attribute has been removed from `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule`. Use `copy_settings.#.zone_id` instead. To learn more, see the [1.18.0 upgrade guide](../guides/1.18.0-upgrade-guide.md#transition-cloud-backup-schedules-for-clusters-to-use-zones).

- `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` and `use_zone_id_for_copy_settings` attributes have been removed from `data.mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule`. Remove any usage of `use_zone_id_for_copy_settings` & replace any references to `copy_settings.#.replication_spec_id` in your configurations with `copy_settings.#.zone_id`. To learn more, see the [1.18.0 upgrade guide](../guides/1.18.0-upgrade-guide.md#transition-cloud-backup-schedules-for-clusters-to-use-zones).

- `hour_of_day` is now defined as required for `mongodbatlas_maintenance_window`resources. This clarification prevents errors when creating new resources. 

- `actions` now is set as `TypeSet` in `mongodbatlas_custom_db_role`. This prevents plan diffs when reordering the `actions` in `mongodbatlas_custom_db_role` resource.  

- `custom_zone_mapping` attribute has been removed from the `mongodbatlas_global_cluster_config` resource and data source. Use `custom_zone_mapping_zone_id` instead. To learn more, see the [Sharding Configuration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/advanced-cluster-new-sharding-schema).

## Deprecations

Version 2.0.0 introduces several deprecations as part of modernizing the provider's user and invitation management. These deprecated resources and attributes will be removed in a future major version release. Migration guides are available to help transition to the recommended replacements:

### Deprecated User Management Resources and Data Sources

- **`mongodbatlas_atlas_user` data source**: Deprecated. Use `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_org_assignment` data source instead. See the [Migration Guide: Migrate off deprecated `mongodbatlas_atlas_user` and `mongodbatlas_atlas_users`](../guides/atlas-user-migration-guide.md) for migration steps.

- **`mongodbatlas_atlas_users` data source**: Deprecated. Use the `users` attribute on `mongodbatlas_organization`, `mongodbatlas_project`, or `mongodbatlas_team` data sources respectively. See the [Migration Guide: Migrate off deprecated `mongodbatlas_atlas_user` and `mongodbatlas_atlas_users`](../guides/atlas-user-migration-guide.md) for migration steps.

### Deprecated Invitation Management Resources and Data Sources

- **`mongodbatlas_org_invitation` resource and data source**: Deprecated. Use `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_org_assignment` resource instead. See the [Org Invitation to Cloud User Org Assignment Migration Guide](../guides/org-invitation-to-cloud-user-org-assignment-migration-guide.md) for migration steps.

- **`mongodbatlas_project_invitation` resource and data source**: Deprecated. Use `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment` resource instead. See the [Project Invitation to Cloud User Project Assignment Migration Guide](../guides/project-invitation-to-cloud-user-project-assignment-migration-guide.md) for migration steps.

### Deprecated Attributes

- **`teams` attribute in `mongodbatlas_project` resource and data source**: Deprecated. The replacement depends on your use case:
  - For managing team assignments to projects, use the `mongodbatlas_team_project_assignment` resource
  - For reading team assignments, use the `mongodbatlas_team_project_assignment` data source

- **`email_address` attribute in `mongodbatlas_atlas_user` and `mongodbatlas_atlas_users` data sources**: Deprecated. The new organization users API does not return `email_address` as a separate field and replaces the consolidated `roles` with structured `org_roles` and `project_role_assignments`.

- **`usernames` attribute in `mongodbatlas_team` resource and data source**: Deprecated. Use `mongodbatlas_cloud_user_team_assignment` resource to manage team membership per user and team.

2.0.0 also includes general improvements, bug fixes, and several key documentation updates. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.
