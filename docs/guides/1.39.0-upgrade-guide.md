# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.39.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.39.0 introduces the following new features and fixes:

## New Resources, Data Sources, and Features

- Added support for the `MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_KEY` and `MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_API_KEY` environment variables which are widely used across the MongoDB ecosystem. These provide an alternative way to configure authentication alongside the existing `MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY` and `MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY` variables.
- The `mongodbatlas_federated_database_instance` resource and related data sources now support Azure cloud provider configuration through the new `azure` attribute. This allows you to create and manage federated databases with Azure. See the [resource documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/federated_database_instance) to learn more.

## Bug Fixes

- **Organization Import Fix**: Fixed an issue where the `org_id` was not being set correctly when importing an existing organization using the `mongodbatlas_organization` resource.
