`mongodbatlas_organization` describes all MongoDB Atlas Organizations. This represents organizations that have been created.

## Example Usage

### Using project_id attribute to query
```terraform

data "mongodbatlas_organization" "test" {
  org_id = "<org_id>"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `org_id` - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the organization.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `name` - Human-readable label that identifies the organization.
* `id` - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the organization.
* `is_deleted` - Flag that indicates whether this organization has been deleted.
* `users`- Returns a list of all pending and active MongoDB Cloud users associated with the specified organization.
* `api_access_list_required` - (Optional) Flag that indicates whether to require API operations to originate from an IP Address added to the API access list for the specified organization.
* `multi_factor_auth_required` - (Optional) Flag that indicates whether to require users to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) before accessing the specified organization. To learn more, see: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-multi-factor-authentication/.
* `restrict_employee_access` - (Optional) Flag that indicates whether to block MongoDB Support from accessing Atlas infrastructure for any deployment in the specified organization without explicit permission. Once this setting is turned on, you can grant MongoDB Support a 24-hour bypass access to the Atlas deployment to resolve support issues.

* `gen_ai_features_enabled` - (Optional) Flag that indicates whether this organization has access to generative AI features. This setting only applies to Atlas Commercial and defaults to `true`. With this setting on, Project Owners may be able to enable or disable individual AI features at the project level. To learn more, see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/generative-ai-faq/.
* `security_contact` - (Optional) String that specifies a single email address for the specified organization to receive security-related notifications. Specifying a security contact does not grant them authorization or access to Atlas for security decisions or approvals.

~> **NOTE:** - Users with pending invitations created using [`mongodbatlas_project_invitation`](../resources/project_invitation.md) resource or via the deprecated [Invite One MongoDB Cloud User to Join One Project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-createprojectinvitation) endpoint are excluded (or cannot be managed) with this resource. See  [MongoDB Atlas API]<link-to-resource-API> for details. 
To manage these users with this resource/data source, refer to our [migration guide]<link-to-migration-guide>.



~> **NOTE:** - If you create an organization with our Terraform provider version >=1.30.0, this field is set to `true` by default.<br> - If you have an existing organization created with our Terraform provider version <1.30.0, this field might be `false`, which is the [API default value](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-createorganization). To prevent the creation of future default alerts, set this explicitly to `true` using the [`mongodbatlas_organization`](../resources/organization.md) resource.
