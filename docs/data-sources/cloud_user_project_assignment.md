# Data Source: mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment

`mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment` provides a Cloud User Project Assignment data source. The data source lets you retrieve a user assigned to a project.

-> **NOTE:** Users with pending invitations created using the deprecated `mongodbatlas_project_invitation` resource or via the deprecated [Invite One MongoDB Cloud User to One Project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-getorganizationuser#tag/Projects/operation/createProjectInvitation)
endpoint are not returned with this resource. See  [MongoDB Atlas API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-getprojectteam) for details.
To manage such users with this resource, refer to our [Project Invitation to Cloud User Project Assignment Migration Guide](../guides/project-invitation-to-cloud-user-project-assignment-migration-guide).

## Example Usages

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment" "example" {

  roles      = ["GROUP_OWNER", "GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_ADMIN"]
}

data "mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment" "example_username" {
  project_id = var.project_id
  username   = mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment.example.username
}

data "mongodbatlas_cloud_user_project_assignment" "example_user_id" {
  project_id = var.project_id
