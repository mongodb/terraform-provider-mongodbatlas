# Data Source: mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster

`mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` describes an Advanced Cluster. The data source requires your Project ID.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.

~> **IMPORTANT:**
<br> &#8226; Changes to cluster configurations can affect costs. Before making changes, please see [Billing](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/billing/).
<br> &#8226; If your Atlas project contains a custom role that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you cannot create a cluster with a MongoDB version less than that version unless you delete the custom role.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "example" {
  project_id   = "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>"
  name         = "cluster-test"
  cluster_type = "REPLICASET"

  replication_specs {
    region_configs {
      electable_specs {
        instance_size = "M5"
      }
      provider_name         = "TENANT"
      backing_provider_name = "AWS"
      region_name           = "US_EAST_1"
      priority              = 7
    }
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "example" {
	project_id = mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.example.project_id
	name 	   = mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.example.name
}
```

## Example using latest sharding configurations with independent shard scaling in the cluster

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "example" {
  project_id     = "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>"
  name           = "cluster-test"
  backup_enabled = false

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `cluster_id` - The cluster ID.
*  `mongo_db_version` - Version of MongoDB the cluster runs, in `major-version`.`minor-version` format.
* `id` -	The Terraform's unique identifier used internally for state management.
* `connection_strings` - Set of connection strings that your applications use to connect to this cluster. More info in [Connection-strings](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/). Use the parameters in this object to connect your applications to this cluster. To learn more about the formats of connection strings, see [Connection String Options](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/faq/connection-changes/). NOTE: Atlas returns the contents of this object after the cluster is operational, not while it builds the cluster.

  **NOTE** Connection strings must be returned as a list, therefore to refer to a specific attribute value add index notation. Example: mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster.cluster-test.connection_strings.0.standard_srv

  Private connection strings may not be available immediately as the reciprocal connections may not have finalized by end of the Terraform run. If the expected connection string(s) do not contain a value a terraform refresh may need to be performed to obtain the value. One can also view the status of the peered connection in the [Atlas UI](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-vpc-peering/).

  Ensure `connection_strings` are available following `terraform apply` by adding a `depends_on` relationship to the `advanced_cluster`, ex:
  ```
  data "mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster" "example_cluster" {
    project_id = var.project_id
    name       = var.cluster_name
    depends_on = [mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.example_endpoint]
  }
  ```

  - `connection_strings.standard` -   Public mongodb:// connection string for this cluster.
  - `connection_strings.standard_srv` - Public mongodb+srv:// connection string for this cluster. The mongodb+srv protocol tells the driver to look up the seed list of hosts in DNS. Atlas synchronizes this list with the nodes in a cluster. If the connection string uses this URI format, you don’t need to append the seed list or change the URI if the nodes change. Use this URI format if your driver supports it. If it doesn’t  , use connectionStrings.standard.
  - `connection_strings.private` -   [Network-peering-endpoint-aware](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-vpc-peering/#vpc-peering) mongodb://connection strings for each interface VPC endpoint you configured to connect to this cluster. Returned only if you created a network peering connection to this cluster.
  - `connection_strings.private_srv` -  [Network-peering-endpoint-aware](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-vpc-peering/#vpc-peering) mongodb+srv://connection strings for each interface VPC endpoint you configured to connect to this cluster. Returned only if you created a network peering connection to this cluster.
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint` - Private endpoint connection strings. Each object describes the connection strings you can use to connect to this cluster through a private endpoint. Atlas returns this parameter only if you deployed a private endpoint to all regions to which you deployed this cluster's nodes.
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.connection_string` - Private-endpoint-aware `mongodb://`connection string for this private endpoint.
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.srv_connection_string` - Private-endpoint-aware `mongodb+srv://` connection string for this private endpoint. The `mongodb+srv` protocol tells the driver to look up the seed list of hosts in DNS . Atlas synchronizes this list with the nodes in a cluster. If the connection string uses this URI format, you don't need to: Append the seed list or Change the URI if the nodes change. Use this URI format if your driver supports it. If it doesn't, use `connection_strings.private_endpoint[n].connection_string`
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.srv_shard_optimized_connection_string` - Private endpoint-aware connection string optimized for sharded clusters that uses the `mongodb+srv://` protocol to connect to MongoDB Cloud through a private endpoint. If the connection string uses this Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) format, you don't need to change the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) if the nodes change. Use this Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) format if your application and Atlas cluster supports it. If it doesn't, use and consult the documentation for connectionStrings.privateEndpoint[n].srvConnectionString.
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.type` - Type of MongoDB process that you connect to with the connection strings. Atlas returns `MONGOD` for replica sets, or `MONGOS` for sharded clusters.
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.endpoints` - Private endpoint through which you connect to Atlas when you use `connection_strings.private_endpoint[n].connection_string` or `connection_strings.private_endpoint[n].srv_connection_string`
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.endpoints.#.endpoint_id` - Unique identifier of the private endpoint.
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.endpoints.#.provider_name` - Cloud provider to which you deployed the private endpoint. Atlas returns `AWS` or `AZURE`.
  - `connection_strings.private_endpoint.#.endpoints.#.region` - Region to which you deployed the private endpoint.
* `paused` - Flag that indicates whether the cluster is paused or not.
* `state_name` - Current state of the cluster. The possible states are:
