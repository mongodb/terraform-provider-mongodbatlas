Hello!

Thank you for opening an issue.  Please note that we try to keep the Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider issue tracker reserved for bug reports.  Please ensure you check open and closed issues first to ensure your issue hasn't already been reported (if it has been reported add a reaction, i.e. +1, to the issue).  

If your issue relates to Terraform itself, please open it in the Terraform repository https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues.

### Debug Output

Note: Debug output can be incredibly helpful in narrowing down an issue but is not required.

Full debug output can be obtained by running Terraform with the environment variable `TF_LOG=trace`. Please create either a GitHub Gist or attach a file containing the debug output. Please do _not_ paste the debug output in the issue, since debug output can be very long.

Debug output may contain sensitive information. Please review it before posting publicly, and if you are concerned feel free to redact it.

### Crash Output
<!--
If the console output indicates that Terraform crashed, please either share a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log` file or attach the file.
