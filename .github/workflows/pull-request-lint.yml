            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! 👋🏼
            
            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Additionally, the subject of the title must start with an uppercase character (e.g. feat: New `search` component).
