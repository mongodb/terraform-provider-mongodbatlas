# advancedclustertpf package

This package contains the WIP for `mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster` in TPF. Current exposed implementation is in `advancedcluster` package. 

**Note:** This file will be deleted once the update is complete and `advancedcluster` package will be deleted.

## Changes in advancedcluster that needs to be added here
(list changes done in advancedcluster which couldn't also be done here at that moment)
- [PR #2825](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/pull/2825) Add new `advanced_configuration.0.default_max_time_ms` attribute to mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster resource and data sources.


- `pinned_fcv` attribute was a recently added attribute in `advanced_cluster`. It has been defined in the new tpf schema but we need to make sure that the implementation is also present.
