# {{.Type}}: {{.Name}}

`{{.Name}}` describes the organization-level AI Model Rate Limit for a specific model group.

~> **NOTE:** Organization-level rate limits represent the maximum allowed limits for all projects within the organization. These limits are determined by your organization's tier and cannot be modified. Project-level rate limits can be configured using the `mongodbatlas_ai_model_rate_limit` resource but must not exceed the organization-level limits returned by this data source.

## Example Usages

```terraform
data "mongodbatlas_ai_model_org_rate_limit" "this" {
  org_id           = var.org_id
  model_group_name = "embed_large"
}
```
