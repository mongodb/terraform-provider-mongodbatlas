# {{.Type}}: {{.Name}}

`{{.Name}}` provides an AI Model Rate Limit resource. The resource lets you create, update, and delete AI Model Rate Limits for the specified Project. Rate limits control the number of requests and tokens per minute allowed for AI embedding and reranking model groups.

~> **NOTE:** Project-level rate limits cannot exceed the organization-level limits. Organization-level limits are determined by your organization's tier and represent the maximum allowed values for any project within that organization.
