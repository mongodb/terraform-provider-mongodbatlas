# {{.Type}}: {{.Name}}

`{{.Name}}` provides a Stream Processor resource. The resource lets you create, delete, import, start and stop a stream processor in a stream instance.

**NOTE**: When updating an Atlas Stream Processor, the following behavior applies:
1. If the processor is in a `STARTED` state, it will automatically be stopped before the update is applied
2. The update will be performed while the processor is in `STOPPED` state
3. If the processor was originally in `STARTED` state, it will be restarted after the update

## Example Usages

{{ tffile (printf "examples/%s/main.tf" .Name )}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import 
Stream Processor resource can be imported using the Project ID, Stream Instance name and Stream Processor name, in the format `INSTANCE_NAME-PROJECT_ID-PROCESSOR_NAME`, e.g.
```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_stream_processor.test yourInstanceName-6117ac2fe2a3d04ed27a987v-yourProcessorName
```
