# {{.Type}}: {{.Name}}

`{{.Name}}` provides a Search Deployment resource. The resource lets you create, edit and delete dedicated search nodes in a cluster.

-> **NOTE:** For details on supported cloud providers and existing limitations you can visit the [Search Node Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#search-nodes-for-workload-isolation).

-> **NOTE:** Only a single search deployment resource can be defined for each cluster.

## Example Usages

{{ tffile (printf "examples/%s/main.tf" .Name )}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import 
Search node resource can be imported using the project ID and cluster name, in the format `PROJECT_ID-CLUSTER_NAME`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_search_deployment.test 650972848269185c55f40ca1-Cluster0
```

After an import, a non-empty plan is expected if the configuration defines the `skip_wait_on_update` attribute. However, the update will not have any effect on the search deployment since `skip_wait_on_update` only relates to the update operations wait time.
