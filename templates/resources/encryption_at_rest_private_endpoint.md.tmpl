# {{.Type}}: {{.Name}}

`{{.Name}}` provides a resource for managing a private endpoint used for encryption at rest with customer-managed keys. This ensures all traffic between Atlas and customer key management systems take place over private network interfaces.

~> **IMPORTANT** The Encryption at Rest using Azure Key Vault over Private Endpoints feature is available by request. To request this functionality for your Atlas deployments, contact your Account Manager. 
To learn more about existing limitations, see [Manage Customer Keys with Azure Key Vault Over Private Endpoints](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/azure-kms-over-private-endpoint/#manage-customer-keys-with-azure-key-vault-over-private-endpoints).

-> **NOTE:** As a prerequisite to configuring a private endpoint for Azure Key Vault, the corresponding [`mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest`](encryption_at_rest) resource has to be adjust by configuring [`azure_key_vault_config.require_private_networking`](encryption_at_rest#require_private_networking) to true. This attribute should be updated in place, ensuring the customer-managed keys encryption is never disabled.

-> **NOTE:** This resource does not support update operations. To modify values of a private endpoint the existing resource must be deleted and a new one can be created with the modified values.

## Example Usages

-> **NOTE:** Only Azure Key Vault with Azure Private Link is supported at this time.

# Import 
Encryption At Rest Private Endpoint resource can be imported using the project ID, cloud provider, and private endpoint ID. The format must be `{project_id}-{cloud_provider}-{private_endpoint_id}` e.g.

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_encryption_at_rest_private_endpoint.test 650972848269185c55f40ca1-AZURE-650972848269185c55f40ca2
