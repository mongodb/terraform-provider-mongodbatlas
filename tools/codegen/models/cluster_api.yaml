        Creates one cluster in the specified project. Clusters contain a group of hosts that maintain the same data set. This resource can create clusters with asymmetrically-sized shards. Each project supports up to 25 database deployments. To use this resource, the requesting Service Account or API Key must have the Project Owner role. This feature is not available for serverless clusters.

        Please note that using an instanceSize of M2 or M5 will create a Flex cluster instead. Support for the instanceSize of M2 or M5 will be discontinued in January 2026. We recommend using the createFlexCluster API for such configurations moving forward. Deprecated versions: v2-{2024-08-05}, v2-{2023-02-01}, v2-{2023-01-01}

            This setting configures the ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` to redact any document field contents from a message accompanying a given log event before logging. This prevents the program from writing potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log. Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file names are still visible in the logs.

            Use ``redactClientLogData`` in conjunction with Encryption at Rest and TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption) to assist compliance with regulatory requirements.

            By default, Atlas scales under WORKLOAD_TYPE. This mode allows Atlas to scale your analytics nodes in parallel to your operational nodes.

            When configured as SEQUENTIAL, Atlas scales all nodes sequentially. This mode is intended for steady-state workloads and applications performing latency-sensitive secondary reads.

            When configured as NODE_TYPE, Atlas scales your electable nodes in parallel with your read-only and analytics nodes. This mode is intended for large, dynamic workloads requiring frequent and timely cluster tier scaling. This is the fastest scaling strategy, but it might impact latency of workloads when performing extensive secondary reads.

If not, MongoDB Cloud creates them as part of the deployment. It assigns the VPC a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block. To limit a new VPC peering connection to one Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block and region, create the connection first. Deploy the cluster after the connection starts. GCP Clusters and Multi-region clusters require one VPC peering connection for each region. MongoDB nodes can use only the peering connection that resides in the same region as the nodes to communicate with the peered VPC.

            Human-readable label that indicates any current activity being taken on this cluster by the Atlas control plane. With the exception of CREATING and DELETING states, clusters should always be available and have a Primary node even when in states indicating ongoing activity.

             - `IDLE`: Atlas is making no changes to this cluster and all changes requested via the UI or API can be assumed to have been applied.
             - `CREATING`: A cluster being provisioned for the very first time returns state CREATING until it is ready for connections. Ensure IP Access List and DB Users are configured before attempting to connect.
             - `UPDATING`: A change requested via the UI, API, AutoScaling, or other scheduled activity is taking place.
             - `DELETING`: The cluster is in the process of deletion and will soon be deleted.
             - `REPAIRING`: One or more nodes in the cluster are being returned to service by the Atlas control plane. Other nodes should continue to provide service as normal.
