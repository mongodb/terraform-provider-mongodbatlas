# mongodbatlas_project_invitation

`mongodbatlas_project_invitation` provides a Project Invitation resource. This represents an invitation for an Atlas User within an Atlas Project.

Each invitation for an Atlas user has a set of roles that provide access to a project in an organisation.

The roles that can be utilised can be found in the [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#project-roles), which map to:

* GROUP_OWNER
* GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER
* GROUP_READ_ONLY
* GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_ADMIN
* GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_WRITE
* GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.

~> **IMPORTANT:** All arguments including the password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html)
