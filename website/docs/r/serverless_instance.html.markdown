# mongodbatlas_serverless_instance

`mongodbatlas_serverless_instance` provides a Serverless Instance resource. This allows serverless instances to be created.

For a full list of unsupported features, see [Serverless Instance Limitations](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/serverless-instance-limitations/).
> In order to use this resource in Terraform you'll need to set the environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_ENABLE_BETA=true`.

## Example Usage

### Basic
```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_serverless_instance" "test" {
  project_id   = "<PROJECT_ID>"
  name         = "<SERVERLESS_INSTANCE_NAME>"

  provider_settings_backing_provider_name = "AWS"
  provider_settings_provider_name = "SERVERLESS"
  provider_settings_region_name = "US_EAST_1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) Human-readable label that identifies the serverless instance.
* `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the organization or project you want to create the serverless instance within.
* `provider_settings_backing_provider_name` - (Required) Cloud service provider on which MongoDB Cloud provisioned the serverless instance.
* `provider_settings_provider_name` - (Required) Cloud service provider that applies to the provisioned the serverless instance.
