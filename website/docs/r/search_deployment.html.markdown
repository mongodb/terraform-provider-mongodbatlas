# Resource: mongodbatlas_search_deployment

`mongodbatlas_search_deployment` provides a Search Deployment resource. The resource lets you create, edit and delete dedicated search nodes in a cluster.

-> **NOTE:** For details on supported cloud providers and existing limitations you can visit the [Search Node Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#search-nodes-for-workload-isolation).
-> **NOTE:** Only a single search deployment resource can be defined for each cluster.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_search_deployment" "test" {
  project_id = "PROJECT ID"
  cluster_name = "NAME OF CLUSTER"
  specs = [
    {
      instance_size = "S20_HIGHCPU_NVME"
      node_count = 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project.
* `cluster_name` - (Required) Label that identifies the cluster to create search nodes for.
* `specs` - (Required) List of settings that configure the search nodes for your cluster. This list is currently limited to defining a single element. See [specs](#specs).
* `timeouts`- (Optional) The time to wait for search nodes to be created, updated, or deleted. The timeout value is defined by a signed sequence of decimal numbers with a time unit suffix such as: `1h45m`, `300s`, `10m`, .... The valid time units are:  `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. The attribute must be defined with [nested attributes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/timeouts#attribute). The default timeout for create, update, and delete is `3h`. Learn more about timeouts [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/timeouts).

### Specs

Specs list is defined as a ["list nested attribute"](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/attributes/list-nested) containing a single element.

* `instance_size` - (Required) Hardware specification for the search node instance sizes. The [MongoDB Atlas API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Atlas-Search/operation/createAtlasSearchDeployment) describes the valid values. More details can also be found in the [Search Node Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#search-tier).
* `node_count` - (Required) Number of search nodes in the cluster.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `state_name` - Human-readable label that indicates the current operating condition of this search node deployment.

## Import

Search node resource can be imported using the project ID and cluster name, in the format `PROJECT_ID-CLUSTER_NAME`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_search_deployment.test 650972848269185c55f40ca1-Cluster0
```
