# Resource: mongodbatlas_stream_instance

`mongodbatlas_stream_instance` provides a Stream Instance resource. The resource lets you create, edit, and delete stream instances in a project.

-> **NOTE:** Atlas Stream Processing is currently in preview, you'll need to set the environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_ENABLE_BETA=true` to use this resource. To learn more about stream processing and existing limitations, see the [Atlas Stream Processing Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-sp/overview/#atlas-stream-processing-overview).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_stream_instance" "test" {
    project_id = var.project_id
	instance_name = "InstanceName"
	data_process_region = {
		region = "VIRGINIA_USA"
		cloud_provider = "AWS"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project.
* `instance_name` - (Required) Human-readable label that identifies the stream instance.
* `data_process_region` - (Required) Cloud service provider and region where MongoDB Cloud performs stream processing. See [data process region](#data-process-region).
* `stream_config` - (Optional) Configuration options for an Atlas Stream Processing Instance. See [stream config](#stream-config)


### Data Process Region

* `cloud_provider` - (Required) Label that identifies the cloud service provider where MongoDB Cloud performs stream processing. The [MongoDB Atlas API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Streams/operation/createStreamInstance) describes the valid values.
* `region` - (Required) Name of the cloud provider region hosting Atlas Stream Processing. The [MongoDB Atlas API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Streams/operation/createStreamInstance) describes the valid values.

### Stream Config

* `tier` - (Required) Selected tier for the Stream Instance. Configures Memory / VCPU allowances. The [MongoDB Atlas API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Streams/operation/createStreamInstance) describes the valid values.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `hostnames` - List that contains the hostnames assigned to the stream instance.

## Import

You can import stream instance resource using the project ID and instance name, in the format `PROJECT_ID-INSTANCE_NAME`. For example:

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_stream_instance.test 650972848269185c55f40ca1-InstanceName
```

The [Terraform Provider Examples Section](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/examples/mongodbatlas_stream_instance/atlas-streams-user-journey.md) also contains details on the overall support for Atlas Streams Processing in Terraform.
