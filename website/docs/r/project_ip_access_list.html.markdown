# mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list

`mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list` provides an IP Access List entry resource. The access list grants access from IPs, CIDRs or AWS Security Groups (if VPC Peering is enabled) to clusters within the Project.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.

~> **IMPORTANT:**
When you remove an entry from the access list, existing connections from the removed address(es) may remain open for a variable amount of time. How much time passes before Atlas closes the connection depends on several factors, including how the connection was established, the particular behavior of the application or driver using the address, and the connection protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP). This is particularly important to consider when changing an existing IP address or CIDR block as they cannot be updated via the Provider (comments can however), hence a change will force the destruction and recreation of entries.   


## Example Usage

### Using CIDR Block
```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list" "test" {
  project_id = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  cidr_block = "1.2.3.4/32"
  comment    = "cidr block for tf acc testing"
}
```

### Using IP Address
```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list" "test" {
  project_id = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  ip_address = "2.3.4.5"
  comment    = "ip address for tf acc testing"
}
```

### Using an AWS Security Group
```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_network_container" "test" {
  project_id       = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  atlas_cidr_block = "192.168.208.0/21"
  provider_name    = "AWS"
  region_name      = "US_EAST_1"
}

resource "mongodbatlas_network_peering" "test" {
  project_id             = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  container_id           = mongodbatlas_network_container.test.container_id
  accepter_region_name   = "us-east-1"
  provider_name          = "AWS"
  route_table_cidr_block = "172.31.0.0/16"
  vpc_id                 = "vpc-0d93d6f69f1578bd8"
  aws_account_id         = "232589400519"
}

resource "mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list" "test" {
  project_id         = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  aws_security_group = "sg-0026348ec11780bd1"
  comment            = "TestAcc for awsSecurityGroup"

  depends_on = ["mongodbatlas_network_peering.test"]
}
```

~> **IMPORTANT:** In order to use AWS Security Group(s) VPC Peering must be enabled like above example.

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) Unique identifier for the project to which you want to add one or more access list entries.
* `aws_security_group` - (Optional) Unique identifier of the AWS security group to add to the access list. Your access list entry can include only one `awsSecurityGroup`, one `cidrBlock`, or one `ipAddress`.
* `cidr_block` - (Optional) Range of IP addresses in CIDR notation to be added to the access list. Your access list entry can include only one `awsSecurityGroup`, one `cidrBlock`, or one `ipAddress`.
* `ip_address` - (Optional) Single IP address to be added to the access list. Mutually exclusive with `awsSecurityGroup` and `cidrBlock`.
* `comment` - (Optional) Comment to add to the access list entry.

-> **NOTE:** One of the following attributes must set:  `aws_security_group`, `cidr_block`  or `ip_address`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Unique identifier used for terraform for internal manages and can be used to import.

## Import

IP Access List entries can be imported using the `project_id` and `cidr_block` or `ip_address`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list.test 5d0f1f74cf09a29120e123cd-10.242.88.0/21
```
