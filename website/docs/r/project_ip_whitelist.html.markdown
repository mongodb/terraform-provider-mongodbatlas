# mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist DEPRECATED

`mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist` provides an IP Whitelist entry resource. The whitelist grants access from IPs, CIDRs or AWS Security Groups (if VPC Peering is enabled) to clusters within the Project.

~> **IMPORTANT:**
Recently we have made changes to modernize the terminology we use in Atlas. The term “Whitelist” has been deprecated in favor of “Access List”.  The Project IP whitelist resource has been deprecated and will be disabled in June 2021.  Please move to using the [Project IP Access List](https://tf-registry.herokuapp.com/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/project_ip_access_list) resource before June 2021.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.ß

~> **IMPORTANT:**
When you remove an entry from the whitelist, existing connections from the removed address(es) may remain open for a variable amount of time. How much time passes before Atlas closes the connection depends on several factors, including how the connection was established, the particular behavior of the application or driver using the address, and the connection protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP). This is particularly important to consider when changing an existing IP address or CIDR block as they cannot be updated via the Provider (comments can however), hence a change will force the destruction and recreation of entries.   

## Example Usage

### Using CIDR Block
```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist" "test" {
  project_id = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  cidr_block = "1.2.3.4/32"
  comment    = "cidr block for tf acc testing"
}
```

### Using IP Address
```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist" "test" {
  project_id = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  ip_address = "2.3.4.5"
  comment    = "ip address for tf acc testing"
}
```

### Using an AWS Security Group
```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_network_container" "test" {
  project_id       = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  atlas_cidr_block = "192.168.208.0/21"
  provider_name    = "AWS"
  region_name      = "US_EAST_1"
}

resource "mongodbatlas_network_peering" "test" {
  project_id             = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  container_id           = mongodbatlas_network_container.test.container_id
  accepter_region_name   = "us-east-1"
  provider_name          = "AWS"
  route_table_cidr_block = "172.31.0.0/16"
  vpc_id                 = "vpc-0d93d6f69f1578bd8"
  aws_account_id         = "232589400519"
}

resource "mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist" "test" {
  project_id         = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  aws_security_group = "sg-0026348ec11780bd1"
  comment            = "TestAcc for awsSecurityGroup"

  depends_on = ["mongodbatlas_network_peering.test"]
}
```

~> **IMPORTANT:** In order to use AWS Security Group(s) VPC Peering must be enabled like above example.

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project in which to add the whitelist entry.
* `aws_security_group` - (Optional) ID of the whitelisted AWS security group. Mutually exclusive with `cidr_block` and `ip_address`.
* `cidr_block` - (Optional) Whitelist entry in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Mutually exclusive with `aws_security_group` and `ip_address`.
* `ip_address` - (Optional) Whitelisted IP address. Mutually exclusive with `aws_security_group` and `cidr_block`.
* `comment` - (Optional) Comment to add to the whitelist entry.

-> **NOTE:** One of the following attributes must set:  `aws_security_group`, `cidr_block`  or `ip_address`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Unique identifier used for terraform for internal manages and can be used to import.

## Import

IP Whitelist entries can be imported using the `project_id` and `cidr_block` or `ip_address`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist.test 5d0f1f74cf09a29120e123cd-10.242.88.0/21
```
