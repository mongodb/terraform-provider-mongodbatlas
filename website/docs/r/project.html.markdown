# mongodbatlas_project

`mongodbatlas_project` provides a Project resource. This allows project to be created.

~> **IMPORTANT WARNING:**  Changing the name of an existing Project in your Terraform configuration will result the destruction of that Project and related resources (including Clusters) and the re-creation of those resources.  Terraform will inform you of the destroyed/created resources before applying so be sure to verify any change to your environment before applying.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_project" "test" {
  name   = "project-name"
  org_id = "<ORG_ID>"
  project_owner_id = "<OWNER_ACCOUNT_ID>"

  teams {
    team_id    = "5e0fa8c99ccf641c722fe645"
    role_names = ["GROUP_OWNER"]

  }
  teams {
    team_id    = "5e1dd7b4f2a30ba80a70cd4rw"
    role_names = ["GROUP_READ_ONLY", "GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_WRITE"]
  }
}
```
