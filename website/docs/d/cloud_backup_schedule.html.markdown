# mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule

`mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule` provides a Cloud Backup Schedule datasource. An Atlas Cloud Backup Schedule provides the current snapshot schedule and retention settings for the cluster. 

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_cluster" "my_cluster" {
  project_id   = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  name         = "clusterTest"
  disk_size_gb = 5

  //Provider Settings "block"
  provider_name               = "AWS"
  provider_region_name        = "EU_CENTRAL_1"
  provider_instance_size_name = "M10"
  cloud_backup     = true // enable cloud backup snapshots
  provider_disk_iops          = 100
}

resource "mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule" "test" {
  project_id   = mongodbatlas_cluster.my_cluster.project_id
  cluster_name = mongodbatlas_cluster.my_cluster.name

  reference_hour_of_day    = 3
  reference_minute_of_hour = 45
  restore_window_days      = 4
}

data "mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule" "test" {
  project_id   = mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule.test.project_id
  cluster_name = mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule.test.cluster_name
}
```
