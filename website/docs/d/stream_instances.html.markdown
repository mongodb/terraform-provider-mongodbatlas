}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project.

* `page_num` - (Optional) Number of the page that displays the current set of the total objects that the response returns. Defaults to `1`.
* `items_per_page` - (Optional) Number of items that the response returns per page, up to a maximum of `500`. Defaults to `100`.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, it also exports the following attributes:

* `results` - A list where each element contains a Stream Instance.
* `total_count` - Count of the total number of items in the result set. The count might be greater than the number of objects in the results array if the entire result set is paginated.

### Stream Instance

* `project_id` - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project.
