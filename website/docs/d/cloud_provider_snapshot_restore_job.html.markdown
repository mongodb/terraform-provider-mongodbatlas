# mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job

`mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job` provides a Cloud Backup Snapshot Restore Job datasource. Gets all the cloud backup snapshot restore jobs for the specified cluster.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.

## Example Usage
First create a snapshot of the desired cluster. Then request that snapshot be restored in an automated fashion to the designated cluster and project.

```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot" "test" {
  project_id          = "5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6"
  cluster_name      = "MyCluster"
  description       = "MyDescription"
  retention_in_days = 1
}

resource "mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job" "test" {
  project_id     = "5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6"
  cluster_name = "MyCluster"
  snapshot_id  = "${mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot.test.id}"
  delivery_type {
    automated = true
    target_cluster_name = "MyCluster"
    target_project_id     = "5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6"
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job" "test" {
  project_id     = mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job.test.project_id
  cluster_name = mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job.test.cluster_name
  job_id       = mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job.test.id
}
```

* `id` -	The unique identifier of the restore job.
* `snapshot_id` -	Unique identifier of the source snapshot ID of the restore job.
* `target_group_id` -	Name of the target Atlas project of the restore job. Only visible if deliveryType is automated.
* `target_cluster_name` -	Name of the target Atlas cluster to which the restore job restores the snapshot. Only visible if deliveryType is automated.
* `timestamp` - Timestamp in ISO 8601 date and time format in UTC when the snapshot associated to snapshotId was taken.
* `oplogTs` - Timestamp in the number of seconds that have elapsed since the UNIX epoch.
