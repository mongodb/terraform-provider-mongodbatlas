# Data Source: mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service

`mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service` describe a Private Endpoint Link. This represents a Private Endpoint Link Connection that wants to retrieve details in an Atlas project.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.

## Example with AWS

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint" "test" {
  project_id    = "<PROJECT_ID>"
  provider_name = "AWS"
  region        = "US_EAST_1"
}

resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "ptfe_service" {
  vpc_id             = "vpc-7fc0a543"
  service_name       = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test.endpoint_service_name
  vpc_endpoint_type  = "Interface"
  subnet_ids         = ["subnet-de0406d2"]
  security_group_ids = ["sg-3f238186"]
}

resource "mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service" "test" {
  project_id          = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test.project_id
  private_link_id     = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test.private_link_id
  endpoint_service_id = aws_vpc_endpoint.ptfe_service.id
  provider_name       = "AWS"
}

data "mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service" "test" {
  project_id            = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test.project_id
  private_link_id       = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test.private_link_id
  interface_endpoint_id = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test.interface_endpoint_id
}
```

## Example with Azure

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint" "test" {
  project_id    = var.project_id
  provider_name = "AZURE"
  region        = "eastus2"
}

resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "test" {
  name                = "endpoint-test"
  location            = data.azurerm_resource_group.test.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.test.id
  private_service_connection {
    name                           = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test.private_link_service_name
    private_connection_resource_id = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test.private_link_service_resource_id
    is_manual_connection           = true
    request_message                = "Azure Private Link test"
  }

}

resource "mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service" "test" {
  project_id                  = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test.project_id
  private_link_id             = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test.private_link_id
  endpoint_service_id         = azurerm_private_endpoint.test.id
  private_endpoint_ip_address = azurerm_private_endpoint.test.private_service_connection.0.private_ip_address
  provider_name               = "AZURE"
}

data "mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service" "test" {
  project_id            = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test.project_id
  private_link_id       = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test.private_link_id
  interface_endpoint_id = mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test.interface_endpoint_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) Unique identifier for the project.
* `private_link_id` - (Required) Unique identifier of the private endpoint service for which you want to retrieve a private endpoint.
* `endpoint_service_id` - (Required) Unique identifier of the `AWS` or `AZURE` resource.
* `provider_name` - (Required) Cloud provider for which you want to create a private endpoint. Atlas accepts `AWS` or `AZURE`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Terraform's unique identifier used internally for state management.
* `interface_endpoint_id` - Unique identifier of the interface endpoint.
* `private_endpoint_connection_name` - Name of the connection for this private endpoint that Atlas generates.
* `private_endpoint_ip_address` - Private IP address of the private endpoint network interface.
* `private_endpoint_resource_id` - Unique identifier of the private endpoint.
* `delete_requested` - Indicates if Atlas received a request to remove the interface endpoint from the private endpoint connection.
* `error_message` - Error message pertaining to the interface endpoint. Returns null if there are no errors.
* `aws_connection_status` - Status of the interface endpoint for AWS.
  Returns one of the following values:
  * `NONE` - Atlas created the network load balancer and VPC endpoint service, but AWS hasnâ€™t yet created the VPC endpoint.
  * `PENDING_ACCEPTANCE` - AWS has received the connection request from your VPC endpoint to the Atlas VPC endpoint service.
  * `PENDING` - AWS is establishing the connection between your VPC endpoint and the Atlas VPC endpoint service.
  * `AVAILABLE` - Atlas VPC resources are connected to the VPC endpoint in your VPC. You can connect to Atlas clusters in this region using AWS PrivateLink.
  * `REJECTED` - AWS failed to establish a connection between Atlas VPC resources to the VPC endpoint in your VPC.
  * `DELETING` - Atlas is removing the interface endpoint from the private endpoint connection.
* `azure_status` - Status of the interface endpoint for AZURE.
  Returns one of the following values:
  * `INITIATING` - Atlas has not yet accepted the connection to your private endpoint.
  * `AVAILABLE` - Atlas approved the connection to your private endpoint.
  * `FAILED` - Atlas failed to accept the connection your private endpoint.
  * `DELETING` - Atlas is removing the connection to your private endpoint from the Private Link service.
* `gcp_status` - Status of the interface endpoint for GCP.
  Returns one of the following values:
  * `INITIATING` - Atlas has not yet accepted the connection to your private endpoint.
  * `AVAILABLE` - Atlas approved the connection to your private endpoint.
  * `FAILED` - Atlas failed to accept the connection your private endpoint.
  * `DELETING` - Atlas is removing the connection to your private endpoint from the Private Link service.
* `endpoints` - Collection of individual private endpoints that comprise your network endpoint group.
  * `endpoint_name` - Forwarding rule that corresponds to the endpoint you created in GCP.
  * `ip_address` - Private IP address of the network endpoint group you created in GCP.
  * `status` - Status of the endpoint. Atlas returns one of the [values shown above](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/private-endpoints-endpoint-create-one/#std-label-ref-status-field).
  * `service_attachment_name` - Unique alphanumeric and special character strings that identify the service attachment associated with the endpoint.
