# mongodbatlas_alert_configuration

`mongodbatlas_alert_configuration` describes an Alert Configuration.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find **group_id** in the official documentation.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_alert_configuration" "test" {
  project_id = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  event_type = "OUTSIDE_METRIC_THRESHOLD"
  enabled    = true

  notification {
    type_name     = "GROUP"
    interval_min  = 5
    delay_min     = 0
    sms_enabled   = false
    email_enabled = true
  }

  matcher {
    field_name = "HOSTNAME_AND_PORT"
    operator   = "EQUALS"
    value      = "SECONDARY"
  }

  metric_threshold = {
    metric_name = "ASSERT_REGULAR"
    operator    = "LESS_THAN"
    threshold   = 99.0
    units       = "RAW"
    mode        = "AVERAGE"
  }
}


data "mongodbatlas_alert_configuration" "test" {
	project_id             = "${mongodbatlas_alert_configuration.test.project_id}"
	alert_configuration_id = "${mongodbatlas_alert_configuration.test.alert_configuration_id}"
}
```

-> **NOTE:** In order to allow for a fast pace of change to alert variables some validations have been removed from this resource in order to unblock alert creation. Impacted areas have links to the MongoDB Atlas API documentation so always check it for the most current information: https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/alert-configurations-create-config/

```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_alert_configuration" "test" {
  project_id = "<PROJECT-ID>"
  event_type = "REPLICATION_OPLOG_WINDOW_RUNNING_OUT"
  enabled    = true

  notification {
    type_name     = "GROUP"
    interval_min  = 5
    delay_min     = 0
    sms_enabled   = false
    email_enabled = true
    roles         = ["GROUP_CHARTS_ADMIN", "GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER"]
  }

  matcher {
    field_name = "HOSTNAME_AND_PORT"
    operator   = "EQUALS"
    value      = "SECONDARY"
  }

  threshold = {
    operator    = "LESS_THAN"
    threshold   = 1
    units       = "HOURS"
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_alert_configuration" "test" {
	project_id             = "${mongodbatlas_alert_configuration.test.project_id}"
	alert_configuration_id = "${mongodbatlas_alert_configuration.test.alert_configuration_id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project where the alert configuration will create.
* `alert_configuration_id` - (Required) Unique identifier for the alert configuration.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `group_id` - Unique identifier of the project that owns this alert configuration.
* `created` - Timestamp in ISO 8601 date and time format in UTC when this alert configuration was created.
* `updated` - Timestamp in ISO 8601 date and time format in UTC when this alert configuration was last updated.
* `enabled` - If set to true, the alert configuration is enabled. If enabled is not exported it is set to false.
* `event_type` - The type of event that will trigger an alert.

  -> ***IMPORTANT:*** Event Type has many possible values. All current options at available at https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/alert-configurations-create-config/ Details for both conditional and metric based alerts can be found by selecting the tabs on the [alert config page](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/alert-configurations-create-config/) and checking the latest eventTypeName options.

  -> **NOTE:** If `event_type` is set to OUTSIDE_METRIC_THRESHOLD, the metricThreshold field must also be set.

### Matchers
Rules to apply when matching an object against this alert configuration. Only entities that match all these rules are checked for an alert condition. You can filter using the matchers array only when the eventTypeName specifies an event for a host, replica set, or sharded cluster.

* `field_name` - Name of the field in the target object to match on.

| Host alerts         | Replica set alerts  |  Sharded cluster alerts |
|:--------------      |:-------------       |:------                 |
| `TYPE_NAME`         | `REPLICA_SET_NAME`  | `CLUSTER_NAME`          |
| `HOSTNAME`          | `SHARD_NAME`        | `SHARD_NAME`            |
| `PORT`              | `CLUSTER_NAME`      |                         |
| `HOSTNAME_AND_PORT` |                     |                         |
| `REPLICA_SET_NAME`  |                     |                         |


  All other types of alerts do not support matchers.
