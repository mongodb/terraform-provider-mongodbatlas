  group_id          = "5d0f1f73cf09a29120e173cf"
  cluster_name      = "MyClusterTest"
  description       = "SomeDescription"
  retention_in_days = 1
}

data "mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_snapshot" "test" {
  snapshot_id  = "5d1285acd5ec13b6c2d1726a"
  group_id     = mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_snapshot.test.group_id
  cluster_name = mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_snapshot.test.cluster_name
}
```
