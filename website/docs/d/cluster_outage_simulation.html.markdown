# Data Source: mongodbatlas_cluster_outage_simulation

`mongodbatlas_cluster_outage_simulation` provides a Cluster Outage Simulation resource. For more details see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/test-resilience/simulate-regional-outage/

Test Outage on Minority of Electable Nodes - Select fewer than half of your electable nodes. This operation is supported via Terraform Provider. 

Test Outage on Majority of Electable Nodes - Select at least one more than half of your electable nodes and keep at least one electable node remaining. This operation not supported via Terraform Provider. Use the Atlas UI instead. 


-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.

## Example Usages


```terraform
data "mongodbatlas_cluster_outage_simulation" "outage_simulation" {
  project_id = "64707f06c519c20c3a2b1b03"
  cluster_name = "Cluster0"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) The unique ID for the project that contains the cluster that is undergoing outage simulation.
* `cluster_name` - (Required) Name of the Atlas Cluster that is undergoing outage simulation.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `outage_filters` - List of settings that specify the type of cluster outage simulation.
  * `cloud_provider` - The cloud provider of the region that undergoes the outage simulation. Following values are supported:
    * `AWS`
    * `GCP`
    * `AZURE`
  * `region_name` - The Atlas name of the region undergoing an outage simulation.
  * `type` - The type of cluster outage simulation. Following values are supported:
    * `REGION` (Simulates a cluster outage for a region)
* `id` - The Terraform's unique identifier used internally for state management.
* `simulation_id` - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the outage simulation.
* `start_request_date` - Date and time when MongoDB Cloud started the regional outage simulation.
* `state` - Current phase of the outage simulation:
  * `START_REQUESTED` - User has requested cluster outage simulation.
  * `STARTING` - MongoDB Cloud is starting cluster outage simulation.
  * `SIMULATING` - MongoDB Cloud is simulating cluster outage.
  * `RECOVERY_REQUESTED` - User has requested recovery from the simulated outage.
  * `RECOVERING` - MongoDB Cloud is recovering the cluster from the simulated outage.
  * `COMPLETE` - MongoDB Cloud has completed the cluster outage simulation.

## Import

The `mongodbatlas_cluster_outage_simulation` data source does not support import operation.
