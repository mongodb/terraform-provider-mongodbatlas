## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.

**NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your group id is the same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id remains the same. The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term groups.

### Read-Only

- `bucket_name` (String) The name of the bucket to which the agent sends the logs to.
- `create_date` (String) Date and time that this feature was enabled on.
- `iam_role_id` (String) ID of the AWS IAM role that is used to write to the S3 bucket.
- `prefix_path` (String) S3 directory in which vector writes in order to store the logs. An empty string denotes the root directory.
- `state` (String) Describes whether or not the feature is enabled and what status it is in.
