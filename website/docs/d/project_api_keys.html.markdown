# Data Source: mongodbatlas_api_keys

`mongodbatlas_api_keys` describe all API Keys. This represents API Keys that have been created.

~> **IMPORTANT WARNING:** Managing Atlas Programmatic API Keys (PAKs) with Terraform will expose sensitive organizational secrets in Terraform's state. We suggest following [Terraform's best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data). You may also want to consider managing your PAKs via a more secure method, such as the [HashiCorp Vault MongoDB Atlas Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/mongodbatlas).

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.

resource "mongodbatlas_project_api_key" "test" {
  description   = "key-name"
  project_id    = "<PROJECT_ID>"
  role_names = ["GROUP_READ_ONLY"]
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_project_api_keys" "test" {
  page_num       = 1
  items_per_page = 5
  project_id     = "<PROJECT_ID>"
}
