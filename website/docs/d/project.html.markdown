# Data Source: mongodbatlas_project

`mongodbatlas_project` describes a MongoDB Atlas Project. This represents a project that has been created.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.

## Example Usage

### Using project_id attribute to query
```terraform
data "mongodbatlas_roles_org_id" "test" {
}

resource "mongodbatlas_project" "test" {
  name   = "project-name"
  org_id = data.mongodbatlas_roles_org_id.test.org_id

  teams {
    team_id    = "5e0fa8c99ccf641c722fe645"
    role_names = ["GROUP_OWNER"]
  }

  teams {
    team_id    = "5e1dd7b4f2a30ba80a70cd4rw"
    role_names = ["GROUP_READ_ONLY", "GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_WRITE"]
  }

  limits {
    name = "atlas.project.deployment.clusters"
    value = 26
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_project" "test" {
  project_id = "${mongodbatlas_project.test.id}"
}
```

### Using name attribute to query
```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_project" "test" {
  name   = "project-name"
  org_id = "<ORG_ID>"

  teams {
    team_id    = "5e0fa8c99ccf641c722fe645"
    role_names = ["GROUP_OWNER"]
  }

  teams {
    team_id    = "5e1dd7b4f2a30ba80a70cd4rw"
    role_names = ["GROUP_READ_ONLY", "GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_WRITE"]
  }

  limits {
    name = "atlas.project.deployment.clusters"
    value = 26
  }
}

data "mongodbatlas_project" "test" {
  name = mongodbatlas_project.test.name
}
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `name` - The name of the project you want to create.
* `org_id` - The ID of the organization you want to create the project within.
* `cluster_count` - The number of Atlas clusters deployed in the project.
* `created` - The ISO-8601-formatted timestamp of when Atlas created the project.
* `teams` - Returns all teams to which the authenticated user has access in the project. See [Teams](#teams).
* `limits` - The limits for the specified project. See [Limits](#limits).
* `ip_addresses` - IP addresses in a project categorized by services. See [IP Addresses](#ip-addresses).

* `is_collect_database_specifics_statistics_enabled` - Flag that indicates whether to enable statistics in [cluster metrics](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/monitor-cluster-metrics/) collection for the project.
* `is_data_explorer_enabled` - Flag that indicates whether to enable Data Explorer for the project. If enabled, you can query your database with an easy to use interface.
* `is_extended_storage_sizes_enabled` - Flag that indicates whether to enable extended storage sizes for the specified project.
* `is_performance_advisor_enabled` - Flag that indicates whether to enable Performance Advisor and Profiler for the project. If enabled, you can analyze database logs to recommend performance improvements.

* `is_schema_advisor_enabled` - Flag that indicates whether to enable Schema Advisor for the project. If enabled, you receive customized recommendations to optimize your data model and enhance performance. Disable this setting to disable schema suggestions in the [Performance Advisor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/performance-advisor/#std-label-performance-advisor) and the [Data Explorer](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/#std-label-atlas-ui).
* `region_usage_restrictions` - If GOV_REGIONS_ONLY the project can be used for government regions only, otherwise defaults to standard regions. For more information see [MongoDB Atlas for Government](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/government/api/#creating-a-project).


### Teams

* `team_id` - The unique identifier of the team you want to associate with the project. The team and project must share the same parent organization.
* `role_names` - Each string in the array represents a project role assigned to the team. Every user associated with the team inherits these roles. The [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#organization-roles) describes the roles a user can have.

### Limits

* `name` - Human-readable label that identifies this project limit.
* `value` - Amount the limit is set to.
* `current_usage` - Amount that indicates the current usage of the limit.
* `default_limit` - Default value of the limit.
* `maximum_limit` - Maximum value of the limit.


### IP Addresses

* `services.clusters.#.cluster_name` - Human-readable label that identifies the cluster.
* `services.clusters.#.inbound` - List of inbound IP addresses associated with the cluster. If your network allows outbound HTTP requests only to specific IP addresses, you must allow access to the following IP addresses so that your application can connect to your Atlas cluster.
* `services.clusters.#.outbound` - List of outbound IP addresses associated with the cluster. If your network allows inbound HTTP requests only from specific IP addresses, you must allow access from the following IP addresses so that your Atlas cluster can communicate with your webhooks and KMS.
