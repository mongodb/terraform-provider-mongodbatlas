# Data Source: mongodbatlas_stream_connections

`mongodbatlas_stream_connections` describes all connections of a stream instance for the specified project.

-> **NOTE:** Atlas Stream Processing is currently in preview, you'll need to set the environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_ENABLE_PREVIEW=true` to use this data source. To learn more about stream processing and existing limitations, see the [Atlas Stream Processing Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-sp/overview/#atlas-stream-processing-overview).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "mongodbatlas_stream_connections" "test" {
    project_id = "<PROJECT_ID>"
    instance_name = "<INSTANCE_NAME>"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project.
* `instance_name` - (Required) Human-readable label that identifies the stream instance.

* `page_num` - (Optional) Number of the page that displays the current set of the total objects that the response returns. Defaults to `1`.
* `items_per_page` - (Optional) Number of items that the response returns per page, up to a maximum of `500`. Defaults to `100`.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, it also exports the following attributes:

* `results` - A list where each element contains a stream connection.
* `total_count` - Count of the total number of items in the result set. The count might be greater than the number of objects in the results array if the entire result set is paginated.

### Stream Connection

* `project_id` - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project.
* `instance_name` - Human-readable label that identifies the stream instance.
* `connection_name` - Human-readable label that identifies the stream connection. In the case of the Sample type, this is the name of the sample source.
* `type` - Type of connection. Can be either `Cluster`, `Kafka` or `Sample`.

If `type` is of value `Cluster` the following additional attributes are defined:
* `cluster_name` - Name of the cluster configured for this connection.
* `db_role_to_execute` - The name of a Built in or Custom DB Role to connect to an Atlas Cluster. See [DBRoleToExecute](#DBRoleToExecute).

If `type` is of value `Kafka` the following additional attributes are defined:
* `authentication` - User credentials required to connect to a Kafka cluster. Includes the authentication type, as well as the parameters for that authentication mode. See [authentication](#authentication).
* `bootstrap_servers` - Comma separated list of server addresses.
* `config` - A map of Kafka key-value pairs for optional configuration. This is a flat object, and keys can have '.' characters.
* `security` - Properties for the secure transport connection to Kafka. For SSL, this can include the trusted certificate to use. See [security](#security).

### Authentication

* `mechanism` - Style of authentication. Can be one of `PLAIN`, `SCRAM-256`, or `SCRAM-512`.
* `username` - Username of the account to connect to the Kafka cluster.
* `password` - Password of the account to connect to the Kafka cluster.

### Security

* `broker_public_certificate` - A trusted, public x509 certificate for connecting to Kafka over SSL. String value of the certificate must be defined in the attribute.
* `protocol` - Describes the transport type. Can be either `PLAINTEXT` or `SSL`.

### DBRoleToExecute

* `role` - The name of the role to use. Can be a built in role or a custom role.
* `type` - Type of the DB role. Can be either BUILT_IN or CUSTOM.

The [Terraform Provider Examples Section](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/examples/mongodbatlas_stream_instance/atlas-streams-user-journey.md) also contains details on the overall support for Atlas Streams Processing in Terraform.
