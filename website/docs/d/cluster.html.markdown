# mongodbatlas_cluster

`mongodbatlas_cluster` describes a Cluster. The. The data source requires your Project ID.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.

~> **IMPORTANT:**
<br> &#8226; Changes to cluster configurations can affect costs. Before making changes, please see [Billing](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/billing/).
<br> &#8226; If your Atlas project contains a custom role that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you cannot create a cluster with a MongoDB version less than that version unless you delete the custom role.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "mongodbatlas_cluster" "test" {
  project_id   = "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>"
  name         = "cluster-test"
  disk_size_gb = 100
  cluster_type = "REPLICASET"
  replication_specs {
    num_shards = 1
    regions_config {
      region_name     = "US_EAST_1"
      electable_nodes = 3
      priority        = 7
      read_only_nodes = 0
    }
  }
  provider_backup_enabled      = true
  auto_scaling_disk_gb_enabled = true

  //Provider Settings "block"
  provider_name               = "AWS"
  provider_disk_iops          = 300
  provider_volume_type        = "STANDARD"

}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) The unique ID for the project to create the database user.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the cluster as it appears in Atlas. Once the cluster is created, its name cannot be changed.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The cluster ID.
*  `mongo_db_version` - Version of MongoDB the cluster runs, in `major-version`.`minor-version` format.
* `mongo_uri` - Base connection string for the cluster. Atlas only displays this field after the cluster is operational, not while it builds the cluster.
* `mongo_uri_updated` - Lists when the connection string was last updated. The connection string changes, for example, if you change a replica set to a sharded cluster.
* `mongo_uri_with_options` - Describes connection string for connecting to the Atlas cluster. Includes the replicaSet, ssl, and authSource query parameters in the connection string with values appropriate for the cluster.

    To review the connection string format, see the connection string format documentation. To add MongoDB users to a Atlas project, see Configure MongoDB Users.

    Atlas only displays this field after the cluster is operational, not while it builds the cluster.
* `paused` - Flag that indicates whether the cluster is paused or not.
* `pit_enabled` - Flag that indicates if the cluster uses Continuous Cloud Backup.
* `srv_address` - Connection string for connecting to the Atlas cluster. The +srv modifier forces the connection to use TLS/SSL. See the mongoURI for additional options.
* `state_name` - Indicates the current state of the cluster. The possible states are:
    - IDLE
    - CREATING
    - UPDATING
    - DELETING
    - DELETED
    - REPAIRING
* `auto_scaling_disk_gb_enabled` - Indicates whether disk auto-scaling is enabled.
* `auto_scaling_compute_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether cluster tier auto-scaling is enabled. The default is false.
* `auto_scaling_compute_scale_down_enabled` - (Optional) Set to `true` to enable the cluster tier to scale down.

* `backup_enabled` - Legacy Option, Indicates whether Atlas continuous backups are enabled for the cluster.
* `bi_connector` - Indicates BI Connector for Atlas configuration on this cluster. BI Connector for Atlas is only available for M10+ clusters. See [BI Connector](#bi-connector) below for more details.
* `cluster_type` - Indicates the type of the cluster that you want to modify. You cannot convert a sharded cluster deployment to a replica set deployment.
* `connection_strings` - Set of connection strings that your applications use to connect to this cluster. More info in [Connection-strings](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/). Use the parameters in this object to connect your applications to this cluster. To learn more about the formats of connection strings, see [Connection String Options](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/faq/connection-changes/). NOTE: Atlas returns the contents of this object after the cluster is operational, not while it builds the cluster.
    - `connection_strings.standard` -   Public mongodb:// connection string for this cluster.
    - `connection_strings.standard_srv` - Public mongodb+srv:// connection string for this cluster. The mongodb+srv protocol tells the driver to look up the seed list of hosts in DNS. Atlas synchronizes this list with the nodes in a cluster. If the connection string uses this URI format, you don’t need to append the seed list or change the URI if the nodes change. Use this URI format if your driver supports it. If it doesn’t, use connectionStrings.standard.
