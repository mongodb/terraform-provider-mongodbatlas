# Data Source: mongodbatlas_stream_connection

`mongodbatlas_stream_connection` describes a stream connection.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "mongodbatlas_stream_connection" "example" {
    project_id = "<PROJECT_ID>"
    instance_name = "<INSTANCE_NAME>"
    connection_name = "<CONNECTION_NAME>"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `project_id` - (Required) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project.
* `instance_name` - (Required) Human-readable label that identifies the stream instance.
* `connection_name` - (Required) Human-readable label that identifies the stream connection. In the case of the Sample type, this is the name of the sample source.

## Attributes Reference

* `type` - Type of connection. Can be either `Cluster`, `Kafka` or `Sample`.

If `type` is of value `Cluster` the following additional attributes are defined:
* `cluster_name` - Name of the cluster configured for this connection.
* `db_role_to_execute` - The name of a Built in or Custom DB Role to connect to an Atlas Cluster. See [DBRoleToExecute](#DBRoleToExecute).

If `type` is of value `Kafka` the following additional attributes are defined:
* `authentication` - User credentials required to connect to a Kafka cluster. Includes the authentication type, as well as the parameters for that authentication mode. See [authentication](#authentication).
* `bootstrap_servers` - Comma separated list of server addresses.
* `config` - A map of Kafka key-value pairs for optional configuration. This is a flat object, and keys can have '.' characters.
* `security` - Properties for the secure transport connection to Kafka. For SSL, this can include the trusted certificate to use. See [security](#security).

### Authentication

* `mechanism` - Style of authentication. Can be one of `PLAIN`, `SCRAM-256`, or `SCRAM-512`.
* `username` - Username of the account to connect to the Kafka cluster.
* `password` - Password of the account to connect to the Kafka cluster.

### Security

* `broker_public_certificate` - A trusted, public x509 certificate for connecting to Kafka over SSL. String value of the certificate must be defined in the attribute.
* `protocol` - Describes the transport type. Can be either `PLAINTEXT` or `SSL`.

### DBRoleToExecute

* `role` - The name of the role to use. Can be a built in role or a custom role.
* `type` - Type of the DB role. Can be either BUILT_IN or CUSTOM.
