    Provides an Access List API Keys resource.

# Data Source: mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key

`mongodbatlas_access_list_api_keys` describes an Access List API Key entry resource. The access list grants access from IPs, CIDRs) to clusters within the Project.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.

~> **IMPORTANT:**
When you remove an entry from the access list, existing connections from the removed address(es) may remain open for a variable amount of time. How much time passes before Atlas closes the connection depends on several factors, including how the connection was established, the particular behavior of the application or driver using the address, and the connection protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP). This is particularly important to consider when changing an existing IP address or CIDR block as they cannot be updated via the Provider (comments can however), hence a change will force the destruction and recreation of entries.   

~> **IMPORTANT WARNING:** Managing Atlas Programmatic API Keys (PAKs) with Terraform will expose sensitive organizational secrets in Terraform's state. We suggest following [Terraform's best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data). You may also want to consider managing your PAKs via a more secure method, such as the [HashiCorp Vault MongoDB Atlas Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/mongodbatlas).

## Example Usage

### Using CIDR Block
```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key" "test" {
  org_id = "<ORG-ID>"
  cidr_block = "1.2.3.4/32"
  api_key = "a29120e123cd"
}

data "mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key" "test" {
	org_id     = mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key.test.org_id
	cidr_block = mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key.test.cidr_block
  api_key_id = mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key.test.api_key_id
}
```

### Using IP Address
```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key" "test" {
  org_id     = "<ORG-ID>"
  ip_address = "2.3.4.5"
  api_key = "a29120e123cd"
}

data "mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key" "test" {
	org_id = mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key.test.org_id
	ip_address = mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key.test.ip_address
  api_key_id = mongodbatlas_access_list_api_key.test.api_key_id
}
```


## Argument Reference

* `page_num` - (Optional)  	The page to return. Defaults to `1`.
* `items_per_page` - (Optional) Number of items to return per page, up to a maximum of 500. Defaults to `100`.

* `id` - Autogenerated Unique ID for this data source.
* `results` - A list where each represents a Projects.

### API Keys
* `org_id` - (Required) Unique identifier for the Organization to which you want to retrieve one or more access list entries.
* `cidr_block` - (Optional) Range of IP addresses in CIDR notation to be added to the access list.
* `ip_address` - (Optional) Single IP address to be added to the access list.
* `api_key_id` - (Required) Unique identifier for the Organization API Key for which you want to retrieve an access list entry.
* 
-> **NOTE:** One of the following attributes must set: `cidr_block`  or `ip_address`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Unique identifier used by Terraform for internal management and can be used to import.
* `comment` - Comment to add to the access list entry.
