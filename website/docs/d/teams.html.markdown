# Data Source: mongodbatlas_teams

This data source is deprecated. Please transition to using `mongodbatlas_team` which defines the same underlying implementation, aligning the name of the data source with the implementation which fetches a single team.

In the future this data source will define a new implementation capable of fetching all teams in one organization.
