# Data Source: mongodbatlas_shared_tier_snapshots

`mongodbatlas_shared_tier_snapshots` provides an Cloud Backup Snapshots data source for Shared Tier Clusters. Atlas Cloud Backup Snapshots provide localized backup storage using the native snapshot functionality of the clusterâ€™s cloud service.

-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.
-> **NOTE:** This data source is only for Shared Tier Clusters (M2 and M5). See [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/free-shared-limitations/) for more details on Shared Tier Cluster Limitations. 


## Example Usage

```terraform
data "mongodbatlas_shared_tier_snapshots" "test" {
  project_id          = "5d0f1f73cf09a29120e173cf"
  cluster_name      = "MyClusterTest"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `cluster_name` - (Required) Human-readable label that identifies the cluster.
* `project_id` - (Required) Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project..

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `results` - Includes shared tier snapshot for each item detailed in the results array section.
