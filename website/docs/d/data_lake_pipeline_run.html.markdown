# Data Source: mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline_run

`mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline_run` describe a Data Lake Pipeline Run.


-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline" "pipeline" {
      //assuming we've already setup project and cluster in another block
      project_id       = mongodbatlas_project.projectTest.project_id
      name             = "DataLakePipelineName"
      sink {
        type = "DLS"
        partition_fields {
            name = "access"
            order = 0
        }
      }
      source {
        type = "ON_DEMAND_CPS"
        cluster_name = mongodbatlas_cluster.clusterTest.name
        database_name = "sample_airbnb"
        collection_name = "listingsAndReviews"
      }
      transformations {
              field = "test"
              type  = "EXCLUDE"
      }
      transformations {
              field = "test22"
              type  = "EXCLUDE"
      }
}

data "mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline_runs" "pipeline_run" {
      project_id       = mongodbatlas_project.projectTest.project_id
      name             = mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline.pipeline.name
}

data "mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline_run" "test" {
  project_id       = mongodbatlas_project.projectTest.project_id
  pipeline_name    = mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline.pipeline.name
  pipeline_run_id  = mongodbatlas_data_lake_pipeline_runs.pipeline_run.results.0.pipeline_run_id   # pipeline_run_id will only be returned if a schedule or ondemand run is active
}
```
