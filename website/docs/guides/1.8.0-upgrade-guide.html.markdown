# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.8.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.8.0 has a number of new and exciting features and changes.

**New Features:**
* You can now enable and manage backup [snapshot distribution](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/introducing-snapshot-distribution-atlas) with [`mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/cloud_backup_schedule)
* You can now manage the lifecycle of your [Programmatic API Keys](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Programmatic-API-Keys) [`mongodbatlas_api_key`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/api_key) 
  *  **IMPORTANT WARNING:**  Managing Atlas Programmatic API Keys (PAKs) with Terraform will expose sensitive organizational secrets in Terraform's state.  We suggest following [Terraform's best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data).  You may also want to consider managing your PAKs via a more secure method, such as the [HashiCorp Vault MongoDB Atlas Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/mongodbatlas). 


**Depreciations:**
* [`mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/cloud_provider_snapshot), [`mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_backup_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/cloud_provider_snapshot_backup_policy), [`mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/cloud_provider_snapshot_restore_job) have been deprecated for a few versions.  We will proceed with removal in the next major version, 1.9.  They have been replaced by >>>add the 3 new ones in the same order as above<<<< respectively. 
* [`mongodbatlas_private_ip_mode`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/private_ip_mode) has been deprecated for a few versions.  We will proceed with removal in the next major version, 1.9.  
* NEW_RELIC and FLOWDOCK in [`mongodbatlas_third_party_integration`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/third_party_integration#argument-reference) resource are now deprecated and will be removed in the next major version, 1.9.

1.8.0 also includes general improvements and bug fixes. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.
