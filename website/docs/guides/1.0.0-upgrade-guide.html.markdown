# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.0.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

## End of Life and removal of Project IP Whitelist and import with Project IP Access List

To upgrade from v0.9.1 to v1.0.0 with the existing resources `mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist`
perform the following steps

1. Remove your existing `mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist` resources from terraform state
   **NOTE** before doing any terraform state change please do a backup

```bash
$ terraform state rm mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist.test
```

2. Change the version of provider to the v1.0.0

3. Perform an import from your existing `mongodbatlas_project_ip_whitelist` to `mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list`
```bash
    terraform import mongodbatlas_project_ip_access_list.test <project_id>-<entry>
```

4. Do a terraform plan (no changes detected)

```bash
terraform plan

(...)


No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences,
so no changes are needed.
