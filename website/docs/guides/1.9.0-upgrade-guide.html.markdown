# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.9.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.9.0 has one new and exciting feature.

**New Features:**
- You can now enable and manage [Backup Compliance Policy](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/backup-compliance-policy/) with resource [mongodbatlas_backup_compliance_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/backup_compliance_policy). If you enable a Backup Compliance Policy, no user, regardless of role, will be able to delete a backup snapshot; see full list of [Prohibited Actions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/backup-compliance-policy/#prohibited-actions). To disable a Backup Compliance Policy, the security or legal representative specified for the Backup Compliance Policy must contact MongoDB support.   


1.9.0 also includes general improvements, bug fixes, and several key documentation updates. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.
