# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.1.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.0.0 has a number of new and exciting features and changes.

* Cloud Backup Snapshot replaces the now deprecated Cloud Provider Snapshot.
* Cloud Backup Snapshot Restore Job replaces the now deprecated Cloud Provider Snapshot Restore Job.

1.1.0 also includes general improvements and bug fixes. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.

## Migration from Cloud Provider Snapshot to Cloud Backup Snapshot

There are two ways to upgrade from v1.0.2 to v1.1.0 with the existing resources `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_backup_policy`
perform the following steps

**NOTE** before doing any terraform state change please do a backup

### Remove the existing and import the new resource

1. Remove your existing `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot` resources from terraform state
   **NOTE** before doing any terraform state change please do a backup

```bash
$ terraform state rm mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot.test
```

2. Change the version of provider to the v1.1.0

3. In order to import the new resource, you must first change your Terraform configuration file, replacing `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot_backup_policy` with `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule`. See the example shared above or find more information in the [mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_schedule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/cloud_backup_schedule)

4. Perform an import of your existing `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot` to `mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_snapshot`
```bash
    terraform import mongodbatlas_cloud_backup_snapshot.test <project_id>-<cluster_name>-<snapshot_id>
```

5. Do a terraform plan (no changes detected)

```bash
terraform plan

(...)


No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences,
so no changes are needed.
```

### Replace the name of resource in terraform state

1. Replace then name of the state in your existing `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot` with `mongodbatlas_cloud_provider_snapshot` in terraform state file (`terraform.tfstate`).
   **NOTE** before doing any terraform state change please do a backup

2. Change the version of provider to the v1.1.0

3. Do a terraform plan (no changes detected)

```bash
terraform plan

(...)


No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences,
so no changes are needed.
