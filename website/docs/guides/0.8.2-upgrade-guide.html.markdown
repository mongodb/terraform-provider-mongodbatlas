## Issue [INTMDB-175](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/pull/398)
### resources created with the affected versions ***v0.8.0/v0.8.1***

The following resources were affected, due to a schema update,
to achieve consistency for multiple providers (AWS) ()[]

```
mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint
mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service
```

### Known issue from v0.8.0 to v0.8.2

If the resources were created from v0.8.0, there was no error in the creation.
However to upgrade to v0.8.2 the state sync steps must be done, otherwise the following error will be shown

```
Error: error reading MongoDB Private Service Endpoint Connection(601881cb0d97874a0eb4eb74): GET https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0/groups/5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6/privateEndpoint/AZURE/endpointService//subscriptions/{SUSCRIPTION-ID}/endpoint/601881cb0d97874a0eb4eb74: 404 (request "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND") Cannot find resource /api/atlas/v1.0/groups/5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6/privateEndpoint/AZURE/endpointService//subscriptions{SUSCRIPTION-ID}/endpoint/601881cb0d97874a0eb4eb74.
```

### Known issue from v0.8.1 to v0.8.2

In terraform v0.8.1 the resource creation is successful in the backend, but fails with the error of the read function.

```
Error: error adding MongoDB Private Service Endpoint Connection(/subscriptions/{SUSCRIPTION-ID}) to a Private Endpoint (6018680618d74a4b62fe0600): unexpected state '', wanted target 'AVAILABLE, REJECTED, DELETED'. last error: %!s(<nil>)

```

### State sync v0.8.2

1. Upgrade your provider to v0.8.2
2. backup your terraform state file
3. Remove the mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint, mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service resources from state
```
terraform state rm mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test
terraform state rm mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test
```
1. Import the resources back into the state
```
terraform import mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test {project_id}-{private_link_id}-{provider_name}-{region}

$ terraform import mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test {project_id}--{private_link_id}--{endpoint_service_id}--{provider_name}

```
5. terraform plan (no changes expected)
```
terraform plan

(...)

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
configuration and real physical resources that exist. As a result, no
actions need to be performed.

```
