## 0.8.2 Upgrade Guide for Privatelink users

### Resources are impacted that were created with versions ***v0.8.0/v0.8.1***
### Fixed in [#398](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/pull/398)

The following resources were affected, due to a schema update,
to achieve support for multiple providers (AWS and Azure):

```
mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint
mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service
```

### Known issue from v0.8.0 to v0.8.2

If the resources were created with v0.8.0, there was no error in the creation of the resource in Atlas.
However to upgrade to v0.8.2 the state sync steps show below must be done, otherwise the following error will be shown

```
Error: error reading MongoDB Private Service Endpoint Connection(601881cb0d97874a0eb4eb74): GET https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0/groups/5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60913b7/privateEndpoint/AZURE/endpointService//subscriptions/{SUSCRIPTION-ID}/endpoint/601881cb0d97874a0eb4eb74: 404 (request "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND") Cannot find resource /api/atlas/v1.0/groups/5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60913b7/privateEndpoint/AZURE/endpointService//subscriptions{SUSCRIPTION-ID}/endpoint/601881cb0d97874a0eb4eb74.
```

### Known issue from v0.8.1 to v0.8.2

MongoDB Atlas provider v0.8.1 created the resource successfully in Atlas, but fails with an error on the read function in Terraform. v0.8.2 has a fix to correct this read error.

```
Error: error adding MongoDB Private Service Endpoint Connection(/subscriptions/{SUSCRIPTION-ID}) to a Private Endpoint (6018680618d74a4b62fe0600): unexpected state '', wanted target 'AVAILABLE, REJECTED, DELETED'. last error: %!s(<nil>)

```

### Steps impacted users must perform to successfully upgrade to v0.8.2 with a correct state

1. Upgrade your provider to v0.8.2
2. backup your terraform state file
3. Remove the mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint, mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service resources from state
```
$ terraform state rm mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test
$ terraform state rm mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test
```
1. Import the resources back into the state
```
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint.test {project_id}-{private_link_id}-{provider_name}-{region}
$ terraform import mongodbatlas_privatelink_endpoint_service.test {project_id}--{private_link_id}--{endpoint_service_id}--{provider_name}

```
5. terraform plan (no changes expected)
```
$ terraform plan

(...)

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
configuration and real physical resources that exist. As a result, no
actions need to be performed.

```
