# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.15.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.15.0 has a number of new and exciting features.

**New Resources, Data Sources, and Features:**


**Breaking Changes:**

Format of `okta_idp_id` that contains the IdP Id in `federated_settings_identity_provider` resource now accepts a different format to align with Atlas API. Both the current and new IdP Id format are accepted in terraform-provider 1.15.0 version.

***WARNING:*** Old IdP Id format will no longer be accepted starting 1.16.0 and onwards. We recommend to update to the new format as soon as possible. A warning will appear if old Id is still being used. Follow the guide below to start using the new Id format.

The old format was a 20-hex characters long string.

The new format is a 24-hex characters long string.

Update guide: 

1. Get new 24-hex characters string ID value
	- Option 1: Use Atlas API v20231001, both of the following endpoints include the new `id` in the response:
		- Use [Return all identity providers from the specified federation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/2023-10-01/#tag/Federated-Authentication/operation/listIdentityProviders) endpoint
		- Use [Return one identity provider from the specified federation by id](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/2023-10-01/#tag/Federated-Authentication/operation/listIdentityProviders) endpoint
	- Option 2: Use `mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_providers` resource: 
	```
	data "mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_providers" "identity_provider" {
  		federation_settings_id = <OLD_ID>
	}
	```
	This will return the list of `mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_providers` with both `okta_idp_id` (20-hex characters Id) and `idp_id` (24-hex characters Id)
3. Replace all occurrences of old Id, such as `identity_provider_id` in `mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_provider`
2. Re-import all `mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_provider` resources using the new Id: 
	-  `terraform import mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_provider.identity_provider  <federation_settings_id>-<new_idp_id>`
3. Run `terraform plan` 
4. Run `terraform apply`
