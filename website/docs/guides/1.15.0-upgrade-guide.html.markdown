# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.15.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.15.0 has a number of new and exciting features.

**New Resources, Data Sources, and Features:**


**Breaking Changes:**

Format of `okta_idp_id` that contains the IdP Id in `federated_settings_identity_provider` resource now accepts a different format to align with Atlas API. Both the current and new IdP Id format are accepted in terraform-provider 1.15.0 version.

***WARNING:*** Old IdP Id format will no longer be accepted starting 1.16.0 and onwards. We recommend to update to the new format as soon as possible.

The old format was a 20-hex characters long string.

The new format is a 24-hex characters long string.

Update guide: 

1. Get new ID value
	- Use Atlas API:
	- Use plural data source: 
2. Re-import all resources using the new Id: 
	-  `terraform import mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_provider.identity_provider  <federation_settings_id>-<new_idp_id>`
3. Run `terraform plan` 
4. Run `terraform apply`
