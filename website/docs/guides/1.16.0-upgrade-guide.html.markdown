# MongoDB Atlas Provider 1.16.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

The Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider version 1.16.0 has a number of new and exciting features.

**New Resources, Data Sources, and Features:**

- You can now configure [Push-based log export to Amazon S3](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/push-logs/) with `mongodbatlas_push_based_log_export` [resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/push_based_log_export).
- [Atlas Stream Processing](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-sp/overview/) reaches GA (General Availability). 
There is no need to use the environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_ENABLE_PREVIEW` any more for `mongodbatlas_stream_connection` and `mongodbatlas_stream_instance` resources and data sources.
- The HashiCorp Terraform Version Compatibility Matrix has been published for the Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider. See full details at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs#hashicorp-terraform-versionhttpswwwterraformiodownloadshtml-compatibility-matrix 

**Deprecations and Removals:**

- Format of IdP Id that uniquely identifies the identity provider when importing [`mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_provider`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/federated_settings_identity_provider) resource and [`mongodbatlas_federated_settings_identity_provider`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/data-sources/federated_settings_identity_provider) data source only accepts the new IdP Id format that is a 24-hex characters long string.
More info can be found in the [previous upgrade guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/1.15.0-upgrade-guide).

- Removal of `project_id` attribute in `mongodbatlas_project_api_key` resource.

- Removal of `password` attribute in `mongodbatlas_database_user` and `mongodbatlas_database_users` data sources.

- Removal of `include_deleted_orgs` attribute in `mongodbatlas_organizations` data source.

- `mongodbatlas_teams` resource has been deprecated in favor of `mongodbatlas_team` which has the same implementation. This aligns the name of the resource with the implementation which handles a single team.
    - For transitioning to the new name you can adjust the name of the resource in your configuration and in terraform state under `resources.#.type` from `mongodbatlas_teams` to `mongodbatlas_team`.

- `mongodbatlas_teams` data source has been deprecated in favor of `mongodbatlas_team` which has the same implementation. This aligns the name of the resource with the implementation which fetches a single team. This also enables implementing a plural data source in the future under the name `mongodbatlas_teams`.

- `scheme` attribute has been deprecated in `mongodbatlas_third_party_integration` resource and data sources as its value is not being used.
