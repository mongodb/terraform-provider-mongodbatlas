This is the repository for the Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider, which allows one to use Terraform with MongoDB's Database as a Service offering, Atlas.

## Support, Bugs, Feature Requests

Support for the Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider is provided under MongoDB Atlas support plans.   Please submit support questions within the Atlas UI.  Support questions submitted under the Issues section of this repo will be handled on a "best effort" basis.

Bugs should be filed under the Issues section of this repo.

Feature requests can be submitted at https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/924145-atlas - just select the Terraform plugin as the category or vote for an already suggested feature.

## Requirements
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 1.0+
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.20 (to build the provider plugin)

## Using the Provider

To use a released provider in your Terraform environment, run [`terraform init`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) and Terraform will automatically install the provider. To specify a particular provider version when installing released providers, see the [`Terraform documentation on provider versioning`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#version-provider-versions).

Documentation about the provider specific configuration options can be found on the [provider's website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/).

## Beta Features
In order to use and/or test beta resources and datasources in this provider you'll need to set the environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_ENABLE_BETA` to true.


```bash
export MONGODB_ATLAS_ENABLE_BETA = true
```
## Logs
To help with issues, you can turn on Logs with `export TF_LOG=TRACE`. Note: this is very noisy. 

To export logs to file, you can use `export TF_LOG_PATH=terraform.log`

## Autoclose stale issues and PRs

- After 7 days of no activity (no comments or commits on an issue/PR) we automatically tag it as "stale" and add a message: ```This issue/PR has gone 7 days without any activity and meets the project's definition of "stale". This will be auto-closed if there is no new activity over the next 7 days. If the issue is still relevant and active, you can simply comment with a "bump" to keep it open, or add the label "not_stale". Thanks for keeping our repository healthy!```
- After 7 more days of no activity we automatically close the issue/PR.

## Thanks

We'd like to thank [Akshay Karle](https://github.com/akshaykarle) for writing the first version of a Terraform Provider for MongoDB Atlas and paving the way for the creation of this one.
