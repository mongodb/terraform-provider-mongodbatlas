# MongoDB Atlas Terraform Provider Versioning Policy

In order to promote stability, predictability, and transparency, the MongoDB Atlas Terraform Provider will implement **semantic versioning** with a **scheduled release cadence**. Our goal is to deliver regular improvements to the provider without overburdening users with frequent breaking changes.

---

## Definition of Breaking Changes

Our definition of breaking changes aligns with the impact updates have on the customer:

Breaking changes are defined as any change that requires user intervention to address.  
This may include:

- Modifying existing schema (e.g., removing or renaming fields, renaming resources)
- Changes to business logic (e.g., implicit default values or server-side behavior)
- Provider-level changes (e.g., changing retry behavior)

Final confirmation of a breaking change—possibly leading to an exemption—is subject to:

- MongoDB’s understanding of the adoption level of the feature
- Timing of the next planned major release
- Its relation to a bug fix

---

## Versioning Strategy

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for all updates:

- **Major (X.0.0):** Introduces breaking changes (as defined by MongoDB)
- **Minor (X.Y.0):** Adds non-breaking changes and announces deprecations
- **Patch (X.Y.Z):** Includes bug fixes and documentation updates

We do not utilize pre-release versioning at this time.

---

## Release Cadence

To minimize unexpected changes, we follow a scheduled cadence:

- **Minor and patch** versions follow a **biweekly** release pattern
- **Major** versions are released **once per year**, with a maximum of **two per calendar year**
- The provider team may adjust the schedule based on need

**Off-cycle releases** may occur for critical security flaws or regressions.

---

## Deprecation Policy

We use a structured deprecation window to notify customers in advance:

- Breaking changes are **deprecated in a minor version** with:
  - Warnings in migration guides, changelogs, and resource usage
- Deprecated functionality is **removed in the next 1–2 major versions**, unless otherwise stated

---

## Customer Communication

We are committed to clear and proactive communication:

- **Each release** includes a [changelog](https://github.com/mongodb/terraform-provider-mongodbatlas/releases) clearly labeling:
  - `breaking`, `deprecated`, `bug-fix`, `feature`, and `enhancement` changes
- **Major versions** include migration guides
- **Minor and patch versions** generally do not include migration guides, but may if warranted
- **GitHub tags** with `vX.Y.Z` format are provided for all releases
